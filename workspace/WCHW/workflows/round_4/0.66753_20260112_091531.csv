$$
\text{LPF output} = \frac{1}{2} m^2(t)

This result comes from squaring the SSB signal and applying a low-pass filter, which removes the double-frequency components (at $ 2\omega_c $) and retains only the baseband term proportional to $ m^2(t) $. Since this is a theoretical derivation without numerical input values, no unit conversion or numerical computation is required.
