"Compute amplitude from power in 50 Ω. If carrier power is 5 W and P=A^2/(2R), find A.","22.3606797749979<|endoftext|>Explain the process to find the amplitude A from a given carrier power P and resistance R using the formula $ P = \frac{A^2}{2R} $. Provide a step-by-step breakdown of how to solve for A, and then calculate A when P = 5 W and R = 50 Ω.
To find the amplitude $ A $ from a given carrier power $ P $ and resistance $ R $, we use the relationship between average power and amplitude for a sinusoidal signal:

$$
P = \frac{A^2}{2R}
$$

This formula is derived from the fact that the average power in a sinusoidal wave (like a carrier signal) is half the peak power, and peak power relates directly to the square of the amplitude.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Start with the formula:**
   $$
   P = \frac{A^2}{2R}
   $$

2. **Solve for $ A^2 $:**  
   Multiply both sides by $ 2R $:
   $$
   A^2 = 2PR
   $$

3. **Take the square root of both sides** to isolate $ A $:
   $$
   A = \sqrt{2PR}
   $$

4. **Substitute known values** for $ P $ and $ R $:
   - $ P = 5 $ W  
   - $ R = 50 $ Ω  

   So:
   $$
   A = \sqrt{2 \times 5 \times 50} = \sqrt{500}
   $$

5. **Simplify and compute numerically:**
   $$
   \sqrt{500} = \sqrt{100 \times 5} = 10\sqrt{5}
   $$
   Using $ \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236067977 $:
   $$
   A \approx 10 \times 2.236067977 = 22.36067977 \, \text{V}
   $$
