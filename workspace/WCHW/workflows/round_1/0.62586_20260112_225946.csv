Channel capacity with SNR=0.5 (linear) and bandwidth B=1 MHz. Compute C in Mbit/s.,"To compute the channel capacity \( C \) in Mbit/s, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB).

Given:
- \( B = 1 \, \text{MHz} = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( \text{SNR} = 0.5 \) (linear).

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 10^6 \cdot \log_2(1 + 0.5) = 10^6 \cdot \log_2(1.5)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(1.5) \):

\[
\log_2(1.5) = \frac{\log_{10}(1.5)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.1761}{0.3010} \approx 0.585
\]

So:

\[
C \approx 10^6 \cdot 0.585 = 585,000 \, \text{bit/s} = 0.585 \, \text{Mbit/s}

Free-space constant K=(λ/(4πd0))^2 with d0=1 m. For f_c=1 GHz compute K.,"We are given the free-space constant:

\[
K = \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_0} \right)^2
\]

with:

- \( d_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \)
- Carrier frequency \( f_c = 1 \, \text{GHz} = 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)

---

### Step 1: Compute wavelength \( \lambda \)

The wavelength in free space is given by:

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c}
\]

where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{10^9} = 0.3 \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the formula for \( K \)

\[
K = \left( \frac{0.3}{4\pi \cdot 1} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{0.3}{4\pi} \right)^2
\]

First compute \( \frac{0.3}{4\pi} \):

\[
\frac{0.3}{4\pi} \approx \frac{0.3}{12.5664} \approx 0.02388
\]

Now square it:

\[
K \approx (0.02388)^2 \approx 0.0005703

"For coherent OOK with A=1, N0=0.5, P1=0.2, P2=0.8, compute V_T.","To compute the optimal threshold voltage \( V_T \) for coherent On-Off Keying (OOK), we use the **maximum likelihood decision rule** based on the probability of error minimization.

In coherent OOK:
- Signal 1 (bit ""1""): \( s_1(t) = A \cdot p(t) \)
- Signal 0 (bit ""0""): \( s_0(t) = 0 \)

Assume additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with power spectral density \( N_0/2 \).

The received signal at the matched filter output is:
- If bit 1: \( r = A + n \)
- If bit 0: \( r = 0 + n \)

Where \( n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \), and \( \sigma^2 = \frac{N_0}{2} \).

Given:
- \( A = 1 \)
- \( N_0 = 0.5 \Rightarrow \sigma^2 = \frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 \)
- Prior probabilities:  
  \( P_1 = P(\text{bit } 1) = 0.2 \)  
  \( P_0 = P(\text{bit } 0) = 0.8 \)

The optimal threshold \( V_T \) is found by setting the likelihood ratio equal to the prior ratio:

\[
\frac{p(r | \text{bit } 1)}{p(r | \text{bit } 0)} = \frac{P_0}{P_1}
\]

The two conditional PDFs are:
- \( p(r | 1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(r - A)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \)
- \( p(r | 0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma^2}} \)

Taking the log-likelihood ratio (LLR):

\[
\ln \left( \frac{p(r|1)}{p(r|0)} \right) = \frac{(r - A)^2 - r^2}{2\sigma^2} = \frac{-2Ar + A^2}{2\sigma^2}
\]

Set LLR = \( \ln \frac{P_0}{P_1} \):

\[
\frac{-2A r + A^2}{2\sigma^2} = \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)
\]

Solve for \( r = V_T \):

\[
-2A V_T + A^2 = 2\sigma^2 \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)
\]

Plug in values:

- \( A = 1 \)
- \( \sigma^2 = 0.25 \)
- \( \frac{P_0}{P_1} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \)
- \( \ln(4) = 2 \ln(2) \approx 2 \times 0.6931 = 1.3862 \)

Now solve:

\[
-2(1)V_T + (1)^2 = 2(0.25)(1.3862)
\]
\[
-2V_T + 1 = 0.6931
\]
\[
-2V_T = 0.6931 - 1 = -0.3069

"Coherent OOK inversion. For equal priors and P_b=10^{-2}, find required E_b/N_0 in dB for P_b=Q(\sqrt{E_b/N_0}).","We are given:

- Binary OOK (On-Off Keying) with coherent detection.
- Equal priors: \( P(0) = P(1) = 0.5 \)
- Bit error probability: \( P_b = 10^{-2} \)
- The bit error probability in terms of the Q-function:  
  \[
  P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)
  \]

We are to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB for which this equation holds.

---

### Step 1: Use the Q-function relation

We have:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 10^{-2}
\]

So, we solve for \( x = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \) such that:
\[
Q(x) = 0.01
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator / software:
\[
Q(2.326) \approx 0.01
\]

Thus:
\[
x = 2.326 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = 2.326
\]

Now square both sides:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = (2.326)^2 \approx 5.41
\]

Convert to dB:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0}\ (\text{dB}) = 10 \log_{10}(5.41) \approx 10 \times 0.733 \approx 7.33\ \text{dB}

"SSB coherent demodulation: message bandwidth 2.5 kHz, noise PSD n0=1e-6 W/Hz. Find input noise power N_i.","To find the input noise power \( N_i \) for an SSB (Single Sideband) coherent demodulation system, we use the following:

### Given:
- Message bandwidth \( B = 2.5 \, \text{kHz} = 2500 \, \text{Hz} \)
- Noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

### Input Noise Power:
In coherent demodulation of SSB, the receiver bandwidth is approximately equal to the message bandwidth \( B \), since only one sideband is transmitted and it carries all the message information.

So, the input noise power \( N_i \) is:

\[

- Roll-off factor α = 0.3  
- Bandwidth = 41.6 kHz  

We use the relationship between symbol rate and bandwidth for a raised cosine filter.

---

### Step 1: Symbol Rate (Rs)
For a raised cosine filter, the minimum bandwidth required for a symbol rate Rs is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Plug in values:
- \( B = 41.6 \) kHz
- \( \alpha = 0.3 \)

\[
R_s = \frac{2 \times 41.6}{1 + 0.3} = \frac{83.2}{1.3} = 64 \text{ kSymbols/s}

Energy of s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Compute E.,"We are given a signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

where:
- \( A \) is a constant,
- \( U(t) \) is the unit step function (Heaviside function),
- \( T \) is a positive constant.

This signal is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \) and duration \( \frac{T}{3} \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \).

---

### Step 1: Energy of a Signal
The energy \( E \) of a continuous-time signal \( s(t) \) is defined as:

\[
E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |s(t)|^2 \, dt
\]

Since \( s(t) \) is zero outside \( [0, \frac{T}{3}] \), we only need to integrate over that interval:

\[
E = \int_0^{T/3} |A|^2 \, dt = |A|^2 \int_0^{T/3} dt = |A|^2 \cdot \frac{T}{3}
\]

Assuming \( A \) is real (as is common unless specified otherwise), \( |A|^2 = A^2 \). So:

### Given:
- Symbol rate \( R_s = 2 \times 10^6 \) baud
- Received amplitude \( A = 2 \, \text{mV} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{V} \)
- Double-sided noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( E_b \)
For 2ASK (coherent), the energy per bit is:

\[
E_b = \frac{A^2}{4 R_s}
\]

Substitute values:
\[
E_b = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-3})^2}{4 \times 2 \times 10^6} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^6} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^6} = 0.5 \times 10^{-12} = 5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( N_0 \)
The single-sided noise power spectral density is:
\[
N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

Note: Since \( N_0 \) is in W/Hz and \( E_b \) is in J (which is W·s), units are consistent for the ratio \( E_b/N_0 \).

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-13}}{5 \times 10^{-11}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01
\]

### Step 4: Compute BER
\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{0.01} \right) = Q(0.1)
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using approximation:

\[
Q(0.1) \approx 0.4602

So,

\[

A PM signal is s(t)=5 cos(2π·2 MHz·t + 3 cos(2π·5 kHz·t)). Find the maximum phase deviation.,"We are given a PM (Phase Modulation) signal:

\[
s(t) = 5 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 2\,\text{MHz} \cdot t + 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5\,\text{kHz} \cdot t)\right)
\]

### Step 1: General form of PM signal
The general form of a phase-modulated signal is:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + k_p m(t)\right)
\]

Where:
- \( A_c \) = carrier amplitude
- \( f_c \) = carrier frequency
- \( k_p \) = phase deviation constant (radian per unit amplitude of message)
- \( m(t) \) = message (modulating) signal

In our case, the signal is:

\[
s(t) = 5 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 2 \times 10^6 t + 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5 \times 10^3 t)\right)
\]

So comparing:
- \( A_c = 5 \)
- \( f_c = 2 \,\text{MHz} \)
- \( m(t) = \cos(2\pi \cdot 5 \,\text{kHz} \cdot t) \)
- The phase deviation term is: \( 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5 \,\text{kHz} \cdot t) \)

This implies that the **phase deviation** is:

\[
\phi(t) = 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5 \,\text{kHz} \cdot t)
\]

### Step 2: Maximum phase deviation
The maximum phase deviation is the peak value of \( \phi(t) \), i.e., the maximum value of the amplitude of the phase modulation.

Since \( \cos(\cdot) \) ranges from -1 to 1, the maximum value of \( \phi(t) \) is:

\[
\phi_{\text{max}} = 3 \,\text{radians}
\]

(And minimum is -3 radians.)

DBPSK over AWGN. Find required E_b/N_0 (in dB) for BER P_b=10^{-6}.,"To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) for a Binary Differential Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK) system over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 10^{-6} \), we use the known BER expression for DBPSK.

---

### ✅ BER for DBPSK over AWGN:
The theoretical BER for DBPSK is given by:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left( -\frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)
\]

This formula applies when the differential detector uses coherent detection, and it's valid for high \( E_b/N_0 \).

We are given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-6}
\]

Set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \exp\left( -\frac{E_b}{N_0} \right) = 10^{-6}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\exp\left( -\frac{E_b}{N_0} \right) = 2 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:
\[
- \frac{E_b}{N_0} = \ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-6}) = \ln(2) - 6 \ln(10)
\]

Now compute numerically:
- \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
- \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 0.6931 - 6 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 13.8156 = -13.1225
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 13.1225
\]

Convert to dB:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(13.1225) \approx 11.18 \, \text{dB}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

"For a bipolar (polar) NRZ system, Pb=Q(\sqrt{2S/N}). If S/N=20 (linear), estimate Pb.","We are given:

- A bipolar (polar) NRZ system with bit error probability:  
  \[
  P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2S}{N}}\right)
  \]
- The signal-to-noise ratio \( \frac{S}{N} = 20 \) (linear, i.e., not in dB).

### Step 1: Plug in the SNR
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2 \times 20}\right) = Q\left(\sqrt{40}\right)
\]

Calculate \( \sqrt{40} \):
\[
\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10} \approx 2 \times 3.1623 = 6.3246
\]

So:
\[
P_b = Q(6.3246)
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the Q-function

The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

For large \( x \), we can use the approximation:
\[
Q(x) \approx \frac{1}{x\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}
\]

Plug in \( x = 6.3246 \):

First, compute \( x^2/2 \):
\[
\frac{(6.3246)^2}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Then:
\[
Q(6.3246) \approx \frac{1}{6.3246 \cdot \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-20}
\]

Now compute:
- \( \sqrt{2\pi} \approx \sqrt{6.2832} \approx 2.5066 \)
- So denominator: \( 6.3246 \times 2.5066 \approx 15.85 \)
- \( e^{-20} \approx 2.061 \times 10^{-9} \)

Thus:
\[
Q(6.3246) \approx \frac{2.061 \times 10^{-9}}{15.85} \approx 1.299 \times 10^{-10}

A QPSK system uses raised-cosine with α=1 and must fit B=100 kHz. Find maximum bit rate.,"To find the maximum bit rate for a QPSK system using a raised-cosine filter with roll-off factor α = 1 and total bandwidth B = 100 kHz, we use the relationship between bandwidth, symbol rate, and roll-off factor.

### Step 1: Understand the bandwidth formula
For a raised-cosine filter, the required bandwidth is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( B \) = total bandwidth (in Hz)
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (in symbols per second)
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor

### Step 2: Plug in known values
Given:
- \( B = 100 \text{ kHz} = 100,000 \text{ Hz} \)
- \( \alpha = 1 \)

Substitute into the equation:

\[
100,000 = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + 1) = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot 2 = R_s
\]

So,
\[
R_s = 100,000 \text{ symbols/second}
\]

### Step 3: Convert symbol rate to bit rate
In QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), each symbol represents 2 bits:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 100,000 = 200,000 \text{ bits/second}

"Shannon capacity. B=50 MHz, SNR=0.1 (linear). Compute C (Mbps).","To compute the **Shannon capacity** \( C \) of a communication channel, we use the **Shannon-Hartley theorem**:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}) \quad \text{(in bits per second)}
\]

Where:
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- \( \text{SNR} \) is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB).

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 50 \, \text{MHz} = 50 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR (linear) = 0.1

---

### Step-by-step Calculation:

\[
C = 50 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 0.1)
= 50 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1.1)
\]

We need to compute \( \log_2(1.1) \).  
Recall:  
\[
\log_2(x) = \frac{\log_{10}(x)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{\log_{10}(x)}{0.3010}
\]

So:
\[
\log_2(1.1) \approx \frac{\log_{10}(1.1)}{0.3010} \approx \frac{0.04139}{0.3010} \approx 0.1375

- Chip rate = 2 Mcps (Mega chips per second)  
- m-sequence period = 31 chips

---

### Step 1: Understand what ""period time"" means
The **period time** is the time it takes to transmit one full period of the sequence — i.e., the time for 31 chips.

---

### Step 2: Use chip rate to find time per chip
Chip rate = 2 × 10⁶ chips/second

TDM multiplexing. A TDM link supports symbol rate R_s=9.6×10^6 baud (assume 1 bit/symbol). Each of l analog channels has f_H=3 kHz and is PCM encoded with n=8 bits/sample at Nyquist. How many channels l can be multiplexed?,"To determine how many analog channels \( l \) can be multiplexed using Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), we need to compute the total bit rate required for all channels and ensure it does not exceed the TDM link's symbol rate.

---

### Given:
- Symbol rate of TDM link:  
  \( R_s = 9.6 \times 10^6 \) baud  
  (Assuming 1 bit per symbol, so this is also the bit rate capacity:  
  \( R_{\text{link}} = 9.6 \times 10^6 \) bits/second)

- Each analog channel has:
  - Bandwidth: \( f_H = 3 \) kHz
  - PCM encoding with \( n = 8 \) bits/sample
  - Sampling at Nyquist rate: \( f_s = 2 \times f_H = 2 \times 3 \text{ kHz} = 6 \text{ kHz} \)

---

### Step 1: Calculate bit rate per channel

Each sample is encoded with 8 bits, and samples are taken at 6,000 per second:

\[
\text{Bit rate per channel} = f_s \times n = 6000 \times 8 = 48,000 \text{ bits/second}
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine how many such channels fit in the TDM link

Let \( l \) be the number of channels. Total bit rate required:

\[
l \times 48,000 \leq 9.6 \times 10^6
\]

Solve for \( l \):

\[
l \leq \frac{9.6 \times 10^6}{48,000} = \frac{9,600,000}{48,000} = 200

Log-normal shadowing with μ= -70 dBm and σ=7 dB. Find outage probability for threshold -80 dBm.,"To find the **outage probability** in a log-normal shadowing environment, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.

---

### Given:
- Mean of received power: μ = -70 dBm  
- Standard deviation of shadowing: σ = 7 dB  
- Threshold for outage: P_th = -80 dBm  

Outage occurs when the received power falls below the threshold:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < P_{\text{th}})
\]

Since \( P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), this becomes:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.

---

### Plug in values:

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.05)

Calculate \( \ln(0.05) \):

\[
\ln(0.05) \approx \ln\left(\frac{1}{20}\right) = -\ln(20) \approx -2.9957

So:

\[
A_0^2 = 2.9957

Calculate \( \sqrt{12} \):
\[
\sqrt{12} = \sqrt{4 \times 3} = 2\sqrt{3} \approx 2 \times 1.732 = 3.464

Compute capacity C1.","To compute the capacity C₁ for User 1 in a two-user uplink where User 1 is decoded first (i.e., successive interference cancellation - SIC), we use the **Shannon capacity formula** for an interference-limited channel.

Given:
- Power of User 1: \( P_1 = 10 \, \text{mW} \)
- Power of User 2: \( P_2 = 5 \, \text{mW} \)
- Noise power: \( N = 1 \, \text{mW} \)
- Bandwidth: \( B = 20 \, \text{MHz} \)

Since User 1 is decoded first, it treats the signal from User 2 as interference. So, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for User 1 is:

\[
\text{SINR}_1 = \frac{P_1}{P_2 + N}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
\text{SINR}_1 = \frac{10}{5 + 1} = \frac{10}{6} = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.6667

p(t) = A [U(t) - U(t - T)]

where:
- A is the amplitude
- T is the pulse duration
- U(t) is the unit step function

The matched filter for p(t) is simply a time-reversed and delayed version of p(t). So the impulse response of the matched filter is:

h(t) = p(T - t)

When p(t) is passed through its matched filter, the output y(t) is the convolution:

y(t) = p(t) * h(t) = p(t) * p(T - t)

The key property of a matched filter is that it maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the moment when the entire signal has been received — i.e., at the end of the input pulse.

Therefore, the output reaches its maximum at:

**t = T**

This is because the matched filter correlates the input signal with a delayed version of itself, and the peak occurs when the entire input pulse aligns perfectly with the filter's impulse response — which happens at t = T.

- \( m = 0 \) (no errors allowed — perfect match required for sync detection),
- Miss probability:  
  \[
  P_{\text{miss}} \approx 1 - (1 - p)^n

### Step-by-step calculation:

First, compute \( (1 - p)^n \):

\[
(1 - p)^n = (1 - 0.0001)^{22} = (0.9999)^{22}
\]

We can compute this using the approximation for small \( p \):

\[
(1 - p)^n \approx e^{-np}

So,

\[

Then,

\[
(1 - p)^n \approx e^{-0.0022} \approx 1 - 0.0022 + \frac{(0.0022)^2}{2} \approx 0.9978

- Threshold power \( P_{\text{th}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)

We assume the received power follows a **log-normal distribution**:

where \( P_{\text{mean}} \) is the mean received power in dBm, and \( X \) represents shadowing.

---

### Step 1: Define the outage condition
Outage occurs when:
\[
P_r < P_{\text{th}} \Rightarrow P_{\text{mean}} + X < 15 \Rightarrow X < 15 - P_{\text{mean}}

For coherent DSB-SC, S_o/N_o=2(S_i/N_i). Assume ideal BPF passing both sidebands so N_i=2 P_n f_m with flat two-sided PSD P_n. Find P_n (W/Hz).","We are given a coherent DSB-SC (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier) communication system and asked to compute the **noise spectral density** \( P_n \) (in W/Hz), using the measured output SNR.

---

### Given:
- Transmitted signal power at demodulator input:  
  \( S_i = 5 \, \text{kW} = 5000 \, \text{W} \)
- Message bandwidth:  
  \( f_m = 4 \, \text{kHz} = 4000 \, \text{Hz} \)
- Output SNR:  
  \( \frac{S_o}{N_o} = 500 \)
- For coherent DSB-SC:  
  \[
  \frac{S_o}{N_o} = 2 \cdot \frac{S_i}{N_i}
  \]
- The input noise power \( N_i \) is due to an ideal BPF passing both sidebands, so:
  \[
  N_i = 2 P_n f_m
  \]
  (This accounts for two-sided noise PSD \( P_n \) over bandwidth \( f_m \))

---

### Step 1: Use the SNR relationship

From the coherent DSB-SC property:
\[
\frac{S_o}{N_o} = 2 \cdot \frac{S_i}{N_i}
\]

Plug in known values:
\[
500 = 2 \cdot \frac{5000}{N_i}
\]

Solve for \( N_i \):
\[
500 = \frac{10000}{N_i} \Rightarrow N_i = \frac{10000}{500} = 20 \, \text{W}
\]

So, the input noise power \( N_i = 20 \, \text{W} \)

---

### Step 2: Use the expression for \( N_i \)

We are told:
\[
N_i = 2 P_n f_m
\]

Substitute known values:
\[
20 = 2 \cdot P_n \cdot 4000
\]

Solve for \( P_n \):
\[
20 = 8000 \cdot P_n \Rightarrow P_n = \frac{20}{8000} = 0.0025 \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
P_n = 0.0025 \, \text{W/Hz} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W/Hz}

Gray-coded QPSK required E_b/N_0. Target BER P_b=2×10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 in dB (use Q^{-1}(2e-6)≈4.61).,"To find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB for Gray-coded QPSK with a target bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 2 \times 10^{-6} \), we use the well-known BER formula for Gray-coded QPSK:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Given:
- Target BER: \( P_b = 2 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q^{-1}(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 4.61 \)

### Step 1: Set up the equation
From the BER formula:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 2 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Take the inverse Q-function on both sides:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 4.61
\]

### Step 2: Square both sides
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.61)^2 = 21.2521
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{21.2521}{2} = 10.626
\]

### Step 4: Convert to dB
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(10.626) \approx 10.26 \, \text{dB}
\]

"AM efficiency. If μ=0.5, compute η=μ^2/(2+μ^2).","We are given:

- Modulation index: \( \mu = 0.5 \)
- Efficiency formula for AM:  
  \[
  \eta = \frac{\mu^2}{2 + \mu^2}
  \]

### Step 1: Plug in \( \mu = 0.5 \)
\[
\eta = \frac{(0.5)^2}{2 + (0.5)^2}
\]

### Step 2: Compute squares
\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25
\]
So,
\[
\eta = \frac{0.25}{2 + 0.25} = \frac{0.25}{2.25}

### Step 3: Simplify the fraction
\[
\frac{0.25}{2.25} = \frac{25}{225} = \frac{1}{9}

\[
s(t) = A_c (1 + \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t)) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

with parameters:
- \( A_c = 4 \, \text{V} \)
- \( \mu = 0.6 \)

We are to find the **magnitudes of the impulses** in the Fourier transform \( S(f) \) at:
- \( \pm f_c \)
- \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Expand the AM Signal

Use the trigonometric identity:
\[
\cos(A)\cos(B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)]
\]

Apply this to expand \( s(t) \):

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

Now expand the second term:

\[
= A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t) \right]
\]

So, the complete expression is:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t)
\]

---

### Step 2: Fourier Transform of Each Term

The Fourier transform of \( \cos(2\pi f_0 t) \) is:

\[
\mathcal{F}\{\cos(2\pi f_0 t)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0) \right]
\]

Apply this to each term:

#### Carrier component (\( f_c \)):
\[
A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) \leftrightarrow \frac{A_c}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c) \right]
\]

#### Upper sideband (\( f_c + f_m \)):
\[
\frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) \leftrightarrow \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m)) \right]
\]

#### Lower sideband (\( f_c - f_m \)):
\[
\frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t) \leftrightarrow \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c - f_m)) \right]
\]

---

### Step 3: Combine and Identify Impulse Magnitudes

Now we collect all impulses:

- At \( \pm f_c \):  
  Magnitude = \( \frac{A_c}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{V} \)

- At \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \):  
  Each has magnitude \( \frac{A_c \mu}{4} = \frac{4 \times 0.6}{4} = \frac{2.4}{4} = 0.6 \, \text{V} \)

Note: There are two sidebands:
- \( f_c + f_m \) and \( -(f_c + f_m) \)
- \( f_c - f_m \) and \( -(f_c - f_m) \)

Each impulse has magnitude **0.6 V**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **At ±f_c**: magnitude = **2 V**
- **At ±(f_c ± f_m)**: magnitude = **0.6 V** each (total four impulses, but each one is 0.6 V)

Given:
- \( h_t = 20 \, \text{m} \) (transmit height)
- \( h_r = 2 \, \text{m} \) (receive height)
- \( f = 2.4 \, \text{GHz} = 2.4 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)

Matched filter output time for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-3T/4)]. Matched filter uses h(t)=s(T-t). At what time does output peak?,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U(t - \frac{3T}{4}) \right]
\]

This is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).  
The matched filter has impulse response:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

We want to find the time at which the output of the matched filter peaks.

---

### Key Concept:
For a matched filter, the output \( y(t) \) is the convolution of the input signal \( s(t) \) with the matched filter's impulse response \( h(t) = s(T - t) \):

\[
y(t) = s(t) * h(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) h(t - \tau) \, d\tau
\]

But since \( h(t) = s(T - t) \), we can write:

\[
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) s(T - (t - \tau)) \, d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) s(T - t + \tau) \, d\tau
\]

This is equivalent to the **autocorrelation** of \( s(t) \) evaluated at \( t - T \), i.e.,

\[
y(t) = R_s(t - T)
\]

where \( R_s(\tau) = \int s(\tau') s(\tau' + \tau) \, d\tau' \) is the autocorrelation function.

Crucially, for a matched filter, the output peaks at the time when the correlation is maximum — this occurs at the end of the signal duration.

---

### Alternative Approach – Direct Matched Filter Output:

The matched filter output \( y(t) \) is:

\[
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) s(T - (t - \tau)) \, d\tau = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) s(T - t + \tau) \, d\tau
\]

Let’s think geometrically.

- The signal \( s(t) \) is nonzero on \( [0, 3T/4] \).
- The matched filter \( h(t) = s(T - t) \) is a flipped version of \( s(t) \) around \( t = T/2 \).
- When we convolve \( s(t) \) with \( h(t) \), the peak occurs when the entire signal \( s(\tau) \) aligns perfectly with \( h(t - \tau) = s(T - (t - \tau)) \).

That alignment happens when the signal \( s(\tau) \) has been fully ""slid"" into the filter. Since \( s(t) \) ends at \( t = 3T/4 \), the peak of the matched filter output occurs when the last sample of \( s(t) \) has just entered the filter — i.e., at the end of the signal’s duration.

So, the **output peaks at**:

\[
t = T
\]

✅ Because the matched filter is designed so that its peak output occurs at \( t = T \), where the entire signal has been correlated with itself in reverse.

Rayleigh clipping model exp(-A0^2). Find A0 for clipping probability 0.5%.,"To find the value of \( A_0 \) such that the clipping probability is 0.5% (i.e., 0.005), we use the **Rayleigh clipping model**:

\[
P_{\text{clipping}} = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

We are given:
\[
P_{\text{clipping}} = 0.005
\]

So, set up the equation:
\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.005
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.005)
\]

Calculate the right-hand side:
\[
\ln(0.005) \approx \ln(5 \times 10^{-3}) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^{-3}) \approx 1.6094 - 6.9078 = -5.2983
\]

So:
\[
-A_0^2 = -5.2983
\implies A_0^2 = 5.2983
\]

Now take the square root:
\[
A_0 = \sqrt{5.2983} \approx 2.302
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
A_0 \approx 2.30
\]

This means that for a Rayleigh clipping model, setting \( A_0 \approx 2.30 \) results in a clipping probability of 0.5%.",2.302,0.0,0.011906700000000001
"Compute Laplacian noise MAP threshold. Noiseless outputs are 0 or A with equal priors, noise Laplacian with parameter λ. Find threshold and P_e in terms of A and λ.","We are given a binary detection problem where the noiseless signal is either 0 or A, each with equal prior probability (i.e., P(0) = P(A) = 1/2). The received signal is corrupted by **Laplacian noise** with parameter λ, so the observed output Y is:

- If the true signal is 0:  
  \( Y \sim \text{Laplace}(0, \lambda) \)

- If the true signal is A:  
  \( Y \sim \text{Laplace}(A, \lambda) \)

We are to compute the **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** decision threshold and the resulting **probability of error**, \( P_e \), in terms of A and λ.

---

### Step 1: Define the PDFs

The Laplace PDF with location parameter μ and scale parameter λ is:

\[
f(y | \mu) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - \mu| / \lambda}
\]

So,
- Under hypothesis H₀ (signal = 0):  
  \( f_0(y) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y| / \lambda} \)

- Under hypothesis H₁ (signal = A):  
  \( f_1(y) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A| / \lambda} \)

Since priors are equal, the MAP rule reduces to comparing likelihoods:
\[
\text{Decide } H_1 \text{ if } f_1(y) > f_0(y)
\]

Take the ratio:
\[
\frac{f_1(y)}{f_0(y)} = \frac{e^{-|y - A| / \lambda}}{e^{-|y| / \lambda}} = e^{-(|y - A| - |y|)/\lambda}
\]

So we decide H₁ if:
\[
|y - A| < |y|
\]

This inequality defines the decision boundary.

---

### Step 2: Find the MAP Threshold

We solve \( |y - A| = |y| \) to find the threshold.

Case analysis:

- If \( y \geq A \):  
  \( |y - A| = y - A \), \( |y| = y \) ⇒ \( y - A = y \) ⇒ contradiction ⇒ no solution here.

- If \( 0 \leq y < A \):  
  \( |y - A| = A - y \), \( |y| = y \) ⇒ \( A - y = y \) ⇒ \( y = A/2 \)

- If \( y < 0 \):  
  \( |y - A| = A - y \), \( |y| = -y \) ⇒ \( A - y = -y \) ⇒ A = 0 — contradiction since A > 0.

Thus, the only solution is \( y = A/2 \).

✅ So, the **MAP threshold is \( \tau = A/2 \)**.

Decision rule:
- If \( y \geq A/2 \), decide H₁ (signal = A)
- If \( y < A/2 \), decide H₀ (signal = 0)

---

### Step 3: Compute Probability of Error \( P_e \)

By total probability:
\[
P_e = \frac{1}{2} P(\text{error} | H_0) + \frac{1}{2} P(\text{error} | H_1)
\]

#### Case 1: Error under H₀ (signal = 0)

We wrongly decide H₁ when \( y \geq A/2 \). So:
\[
P(\text{error} | H_0) = P(Y \geq A/2 \mid H_0) = \int_{A/2}^\infty \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y|/\lambda} dy
\]

Since \( y \geq A/2 > 0 \), \( |y| = y \), so:
\[
= \int_{A/2}^\infty \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-y/\lambda} dy
= \left[ -\frac{1}{2} e^{-y/\lambda} \right]_{A/2}^\infty
= \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)}
\]

#### Case 2: Error under H₁ (signal = A)

We wrongly decide H₀ when \( y < A/2 \). So:
\[
P(\text{error} | H_1) = P(Y < A/2 \mid H_1) = \int_{-\infty}^{A/2} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda} dy
\]

Split into two parts at \( y = A \):

- For \( y < A \): \( |y - A| = A - y \), so:
\[
= \int_{-\infty}^{A/2} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-(A - y)/\lambda} dy
= \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-A/\lambda} \int_{-\infty}^{A/2} e^{y/\lambda} dy
\]

Compute integral:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{A/2} e^{y/\lambda} dy = \lambda e^{A/(2\lambda)}
\]

So:
\[
P(\text{error} | H_1) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-A/\lambda} \cdot \lambda e^{A/(2\lambda)} 
= \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)}
\]

Same as \( P(\text{error} | H_0) \)! ✅

Log-normal shadowing with σ=8 dB. Required threshold is 10 dBm. Find mean μ needed for outage 5%.,"To find the mean μ (in dB) for a log-normal shadowing model such that the outage probability is 5%, given:

- Standard deviation of shadowing: σ = 8 dB  
- Required signal threshold: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \) dBm  
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 5\% = 0.05 \)

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

The received power \( P_r \) follows a **log-normal distribution**, meaning:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where \( \mu \) is the mean in dB and \( \sigma = 8 \) dB.

Outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \), i.e.,
\[
P(P_r < 10) = 0.05

This can be written using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.05
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the standard normal CDF.

Now solve for \( \mu \):

1. Find the z-score corresponding to the 5th percentile:
   \[
   \Phi^{-1}(0.05) = -1.6449

   (This is the standard normal value such that \( \Phi(-1.6449) = 0.05 \))

2. Set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{10 - \mu}{8} = -1.6449

3. Solve for \( \mu \):
   \[
   10 - \mu = -1.6449 \times 8 \\
   10 - \mu = -13.1592 \\
   \mu = 10 + 13.1592 = 23.1592 \, \text{dB}

Compute coherent OOK threshold for equal priors when A=0.2 V.,"To compute the **coherent OOK (On-Off Keying) threshold** for equal priors when the amplitude \( A = 0.2 \, \text{V} \), we follow standard digital communication theory.

---

### 🔍 Assumptions:
- **Coherent detection**: The receiver knows the phase of the transmitted signal.
- **Equal prior probabilities**: \( P(s_0) = P(s_1) = 0.5 \)
- **AWGN channel**: Additive White Gaussian Noise with power spectral density \( N_0/2 \)
- **OOK signaling**:
  - Symbol 0: no signal → \( s_0(t) = 0 \)
  - Symbol 1: signal present → \( s_1(t) = A \cdot p(t) \), where \( p(t) \) is the pulse shape (assumed normalized to energy \( E_b \))

For coherent detection, the optimal threshold \( \lambda \) for maximizing probability of correct detection under equal priors is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{E_s}{2}
\]

where \( E_s \) is the energy per symbol.

---

### ✅ Step-by-step:

Assuming a rectangular pulse over duration \( T \), the energy of symbol 1 is:

\[
E_s = A^2 T
\]

But since we are asked for the **threshold**, and not the error probability, we can express it directly in terms of \( A \).

In coherent OOK with equal priors, the decision threshold is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{A^2 T}{2}
\]

However, **without knowing \( T \)**, we can’t get a numerical value unless we assume a standard unit-energy pulse.

If we assume that the pulse has **unit energy** (\( E_s = 1 \)), then:

- \( A^2 T = 1 \Rightarrow T = \frac{1}{A^2} \)

Then the threshold becomes:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2}
\]

But this assumes unit energy — often, we want the threshold **in volts**, not energy units.

Alternatively, if you're working with a specific time interval (e.g., bit duration \( T_b \)), and \( A = 0.2 \, \text{V} \), then:

Let’s define \( E_b = A^2 T_b \) as the bit energy.

Then the optimal threshold for coherent OOK with equal priors is:

\[
\lambda = \frac{E_b}{2} = \frac{A^2 T_b}{2}
\]

But again, without \( T_b \), we can't give a numeric threshold voltage.

---

### ✅ Most Common Interpretation:
In many textbooks and problems, when only \( A \) is given and no other parameters, it's assumed that:

- The matched filter output (at sampling instant) gives a signal level of \( A \) for symbol 1 and 0 for symbol 0.
- Then, the optimal threshold is simply:

\[
\lambda = \frac{A}{2}
\]

This is valid when the system is designed such that the received signal at the decision point is either 0 or \( A \) volts (e.g., a simple baseband OOK with perfect timing).

---

### ✅ Final Answer (Most Practical):
Assuming the signal levels at the detector are 0 V and \( A \) V, the coherent OOK threshold for equal priors is:

\[
\boxed{\lambda = \frac{A}{2} = \frac{0.2}{2} = 0.1 \, \text{V}}
\]

"Compute miss probability for sync word allowing up to 1 error (m=1). Sync length n=40, channel BER p=10^{-5}. Approximate P_miss≈C(n,2)p^2.","We are asked to compute the **miss probability** for a synchronization word (sync word) of length \( n = 40 \), allowing up to 1 error, with a channel bit error rate (BER) \( p = 10^{-5} \). The approximation given is:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

---

### 🔍 Interpretation:
- **Miss probability**: The probability that the sync word is *not detected* even though it was transmitted — i.e., the received sequence differs from the expected sync word in such a way that it's not recognized as valid.
- Since we allow up to 1 error (i.e., tolerate one bit error), a miss occurs only when **more than 1 bit is in error** in the sync word.
- So:  
  \[
  P_{\text{miss}} = \Pr(\text{≥ 2 errors}) \approx \Pr(\text{exactly 2 errors}) 
  \]
  (assuming \( p \ll 1 \), higher-order terms like 3 or more errors are negligible).

The binomial probability of exactly \( k \) errors in \( n \) bits is:
\[
\Pr(k \text{ errors}) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n-k}
\]
For small \( p \), \( (1 - p)^{n-k} \approx 1 \), so:
\[
\Pr(\text{exactly } 2 \text{ errors}) \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

This matches the given approximation.

---

### ✅ Compute:
Given:
- \( n = 40 \)
- \( p = 10^{-5} \)

Capacity of a 3.4 kHz telephone channel at output SNR 20 dB. Compute C (kbit/s).,"To compute the channel capacity \( C \) of a 3.4 kHz telephone channel with an output SNR of 20 dB, we use **Shannon's Channel Capacity Formula**:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bit/s)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale
Given SNR = 20 dB:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug values into Shannon’s formula
- Bandwidth \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3400 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 100

\[
C = 3400 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 3400 \times \log_2(101)
\]

Now calculate \( \log_2(101) \):

\[
\log_2(101) = \frac{\log_{10}(101)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{2.0043}{0.3010} \approx 6.659
\]

So,

\[
C \approx 3400 \times 6.659 = 22,640.6 \, \text{bit/s}

Union-bound term threshold for QPSK. Want Q(\sqrt{4E_b/N_0})<10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 (dB).,"We are given a target bit error rate (BER) for QPSK:

\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}\right) < 10^{-6}
\]

Our goal is to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Q-function
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]
It represents the tail probability of a standard normal distribution.

For QPSK, the BER is:
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]
Wait — this seems contradictory to the problem statement. Let’s clarify:

In **QPSK**, each symbol carries 2 bits, and the energy per symbol is \( E_s = 2E_b \). The distance between nearest symbols in QPSK is \( \sqrt{2E_s} \), so the Euclidean distance between constellation points is \( \sqrt{2E_s} = \sqrt{4E_b} \).

Thus, the correct BER formula for QPSK is:
\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

But the problem gives:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} \right) < 10^{-6}
\]

This suggests that the expression inside the Q-function is already scaled by 2 relative to the standard formula — perhaps the problem uses a different definition or wants us to directly solve the inequality as written.

Let’s proceed with the equation as given:

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} \right) < 10^{-6}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} \), so:
\[
Q(x) < 10^{-6}
\]

We need to find the smallest \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \), then solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \).

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \) when \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \)

From Q-function tables or using approximations:

- \( Q(4.75) \approx 1.09 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q(4.76) \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q(4.77) \approx 9.7 \times 10^{-7} \)

So, interpolate:

At \( x \approx 4.76 \), \( Q(x) \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-6} \), which is just above \( 10^{-6} \).  
At \( x = 4.77 \), it's ~\( 9.7 \times 10^{-7} \), so we can use:

**Approximate value:**
\[
x \approx 4.76 \quad \text{(since } Q(4.76) \approx 10^{-6} \text{)}
\]

More precisely, from standard values:
\[
Q(4.75) \approx 1.09 \times 10^{-6}, \quad Q(4.76) \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-6}
\]

To get exactly \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \), linear interpolation:

Let’s assume linearity between these two points:

Difference in x: 0.01  
Difference in Q: \( 1.09 - 1.03 = 0.06 \times 10^{-6} \)

We want to go from \( 1.09 \times 10^{-6} \) down to \( 1 \times 10^{-6} \): delta = \( 0.09 \times 10^{-6} \)

Fraction: \( \frac{0.09}{0.06} = 1.5 \) → too much! Wait, actually:

We’re going from 1.09 × 10⁻⁶ at x=4.75 to 1.03 × 10⁻⁶ at x=4.76 — that’s a decrease of 0.06 × 10⁻⁶ over 0.01 in x.

We want to go from 1.09 × 10⁻⁶ to 1.00 × 10⁻⁶ → Δ = 0.09 × 10⁻⁶

But 0.09 > 0.06 → we overshoot. So we need to go beyond x=4.76.

Check x = 4.78:  
Actually, better to use known inverse Q-values:

From standard tables or Python/scipy:

```python
from scipy.special import erfc
import math

# Compute x such that Q(x) = 1e-6
# We know Q(x) = 0.5 * erfc(x / sqrt(2))
def q_inverse(p):
    return math.sqrt(2) * math.erfcinv(2*p)

x = q_inverse(1e-6)
```

Using this or known values:

\[
x \approx 4.753
\]

(From precise calculation: \( Q(4.753) \approx 10^{-6} \))

So we'll use:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} = 4.753
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{4E_b}{N_0} = (4.753)^2 \approx 22.59
\]

So:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{22.59}{4} = 5.6475
\]

Convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(5.6475) \approx 10 \times 0.7518 \approx 7.52 \text{ dB}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Convert received power 6.88×10^{-13} W to dBm.,"To convert power from watts (W) to decibels relative to one milliwatt (dBm), use the formula:

\[
P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{W}}}{1 \, \text{mW}}\right)
\]

Given:
\[
P_{\text{W}} = 6.88 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{W}

PCM rate. An audio signal f_H=7 kHz is sampled at Nyquist and quantized with 12 bits/sample. Find R_b.,"To find the bit rate \( R_b \) (in bits per second), we use the formula:

\[
R_b = f_s \times n

Where:
- \( f_s \) is the sampling frequency,
- \( n \) is the number of bits per sample.

Given:
- The audio signal has a highest frequency \( f_H = 7 \, \text{kHz} \),

Where:
- \( R_b \) is the bit rate in bits per second (bit/s),
- \( B_{\text{first-null}} \) is the first-null bandwidth in Hz.

This is because, for NRZ signaling, the spectrum has its first null at the bit rate itself — this occurs when the pulse shape is rectangular (as in ideal NRZ).

"Minimum mean power for 1% outage. Threshold 10 dBm, σ=12 dB. Find μ.","We are asked to find the mean power μ such that there is a 1% outage probability, given:

- Threshold power: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 12 \, \text{dB} \)
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 1\% = 0.01 \)

Assume the received power follows a **log-normal distribution**, which is common in wireless communications.

Let the received power (in dBm) be:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where:
- \( \mu \): mean in dBm (this is what we need to find),
- \( \sigma = 12 \, \text{dB} \).

The outage occurs when the received power drops below the threshold:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = 0.01
\]

This can be rewritten using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution:
\[
P(P_r < 10) = \Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.01
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the standard normal CDF.

### Step 1: Find the z-score corresponding to 1% tail probability
We solve for \( z \) such that:
\[
\Phi(z) = 0.01

From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF:

"Gray-coded QPSK over AWGN. For BER P_b=3×10^{-5}, find E_b/N_0 in dB (use Q^{-1}).","To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) in dB for Gray-coded QPSK over an AWGN channel with a bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 3 \times 10^{-5} \), we proceed as follows:

---

### Step 1: BER formula for Gray-coded QPSK
For Gray-coded QPSK, each symbol carries 2 bits, and the bit error rate is related to the symbol error rate by:
\[
P_b \approx \frac{1}{2} P_s
\]
where \( P_s \) is the symbol error probability.

The symbol error probability for QPSK over AWGN is:
\[
P_s = 2Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Hence,
\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

This is because Gray coding ensures that a symbol error typically results in only one bit error out of two.

---

### Step 2: Set up equation
Given:
\[
P_b = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\Rightarrow Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Take the inverse Q-function on both sides:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5})
\]

---

### Step 3: Use Q⁻¹ value
From standard Q-function tables or using approximation:
\[
Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.265
\]

(You can confirm this using MATLAB or Python's `scipy.stats.norm.ppf` or similar — since \( Q(x) = 1 - \Phi(x) \), then \( Q^{-1}(p) = \Phi^{-1}(1 - p) \).)

So:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.265
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( E_b/N_0 \)
Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.265)^2 = 18.19
\]

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{18.19}{2} = 9.095

An SSB-SC signal uses carrier f_c=120 kHz and message bandwidth 6 kHz (upper sideband). Specify the ideal BPF magnitude response passband.,"To specify the ideal Band-Pass Filter (BPF) magnitude response passband for an **SSB-SC (Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier)** signal with:

- Carrier frequency \( f_c = 120 \) kHz  
- Message bandwidth = 6 kHz  
- Upper Sideband (USB) used

---

### Step-by-step Reasoning:

In SSB-SC modulation:
- The message signal (baseband) has a bandwidth of 6 kHz.
- For USB, only the upper sideband is transmitted — this consists of frequencies from \( f_c \) to \( f_c + B \), where \( B \) is the message bandwidth.

So:
- Lower edge of passband: \( f_c = 120 \) kHz  
- Upper edge of passband: \( f_c + B = 120 + 6 = 126 \) kHz

The ideal BPF must pass all frequencies in this range and reject all others.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The ideal BPF magnitude response passband is:

\[

Using raised-cosine shaping, what maximum roll-off α is allowable for QPSK?","To determine the maximum roll-off factor α allowable for QPSK in a baseband system, we use the relationship between the bit rate, bandwidth, and the roll-off factor.

---

### Given:
- Bit rate: \( R_b = 4000 \) bits/s  
- Available channel bandwidth: \( B_{\text{avail}} = 3100 \) Hz  
- Modulation: QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)  
- Pulse shaping: Raised-cosine with roll-off factor \( \alpha \)

---

### Step 1: Understand QPSK
In QPSK:
- Each symbol carries **2 bits**  
- So the symbol rate (baud rate) is:
  \[
  R_s = \frac{R_b}{2} = \frac{4000}{2} = 2000 \text{ symbols/s}
  \]

---

### Step 2: Bandwidth of Raised-Cosine Filter
The minimum required bandwidth for a raised-cosine pulse shape is:
\[
B = R_s (1 + \alpha)
\]
This must be ≤ available bandwidth:
\[
R_s (1 + \alpha) \leq B_{\text{avail}}
\]

Plug in the values:
\[
2000 (1 + \alpha) \leq 3100
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for α
\[
1 + \alpha \leq \frac{3100}{2000} = 1.55
\]
\[
\alpha \leq 1.55 - 1 = 0.55

- \( m(t) \) is zero-mean, i.e., \( \mathbb{E}[m(t)] = 0 \).

We are to find the amplitude \( A \).

---

### Step-by-step:

The DC value of a signal is its average (mean) value over time. So, take the expected value of \( S_{\text{LPF}}(t) \):

\[
\mathbb{E}[S_{\text{LPF}}(t)] = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{A}{2}(m(t) + 1)\right] = \frac{A}{2} \left(\mathbb{E}[m(t)] + 1\right)
\]

Since \( \mathbb{E}[m(t)] = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
\mathbb{E}[S_{\text{LPF}}(t)] = \frac{A}{2}(0 + 1) = \frac{A}{2}
\]

But we’re told the measured DC is 1 V:

\[

We are given:

P_b = 10^{-3}

So we set:

\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-3}
\]

Let’s solve for \(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\).

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q(x) = 10^{-3} \Rightarrow x \approx 3.09

(You can confirm this: \(Q(3.09) \approx 0.001\))

So,

\[

"Compute DSB-SC BPF passband. Carrier 250 kHz, message bandwidth 12 kHz. Specify |H(f)|.","For a Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC) signal:

- **Carrier frequency** \( f_c = 250 \, \text{kHz} \)
- **Message bandwidth** \( B = 12 \, \text{kHz} \)

- Upper Sideband (USB): from \( f_c \) to \( f_c + B \)
- Lower Sideband (LSB): from \( f_c - B \) to \( f_c \)

So, the total occupied frequency range is:

Now evaluate the Q-function at 1.7804:

Using a calculator or standard Q-function table:

\[
Q(1.7804) \approx 0.0375
\]

(Remark: You can also use software like MATLAB: `qfunc(1.7804)` or Python: `scipy.special.erfc(1.7804 / sqrt(2)) / 2`.)

"If IM3 equals desired at output 35 dBm, what is the input third-order intercept (IIP3) approximately, given 2-tone test at -6 dBm input produced Δ=30 dB between desired (20 dBm) and IM3 (-10 dBm)?","To estimate the Input Third-Order Intercept (IIP3), we use the relationship between the third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3) and the input power level in a 2-tone test.

### Given:
- Desired output power at output = **35 dBm**
- Input powers: Two tones at **–6 dBm** each
- Output desired power = **20 dBm**
- IM3 power at output = **–10 dBm**
- So, the difference Δ = 20 dBm – (–10 dBm) = **30 dB**

This Δ = 30 dB is the **output IM3 suppression**, i.e., how much lower the IM3 is than the desired signal at the output.

The standard formula relating this to IIP3 is:

\[
\Delta_{\text{out}} = 2 \times (P_{\text{in}} - \text{IIP3})
\]

But since Δ is measured in dB, and power levels are in dBm, we must be careful. The correct relation for a 2-tone test is:

\[
\Delta_{\text{out}} = 2 \cdot (P_{\text{in}} - \text{IIP3})
\]

Where:
- Δ_out = 30 dB (output IM3 suppression),
- P_in = –6 dBm (each tone),
- IIP3 = ? (what we want)

So:

\[
30 = 2 \cdot (-6 - \text{IIP3}) \quad \text{(in dB)}
\]

Wait — actually, it's better to write it in absolute terms using the known fact that the IM3 power increases at 3× the rate of the fundamental, so:

At input power \( P_{\text{in}} \), the IM3 power at output is:

\[
P_{\text{IM3, out}} = 3 \cdot P_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}
\]

And the desired signal power at output is:

\[
P_{\text{des, out}} = G \cdot P_{\text{in}}
\]

But since we know the difference Δ between desired signal and IM3 at output:

\[
\Delta = P_{\text{des, out}} - P_{\text{IM3, out}} = 30 \, \text{dB}
\]

Substitute the expressions:

\[
(G \cdot P_{\text{in}}) - (3 \cdot P_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}) = 30
\]

But we don’t have the gain \( G \). However, from the given data:
- \( P_{\text{in}} = -6 \, \text{dBm} \)
- \( P_{\text{des, out}} = 20 \, \text{dBm} \)

Then:

\[
G = 20 - (-6) = 26 \, \text{dB}
\]

Now plug into the equation:

\[
\Delta = [G + P_{\text{in}}] - [3 \cdot P_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}] = 30
\]

Simplify:

\[
(26 + (-6)) - (3 \cdot (-6) - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}) = 30
\]
\[
20 - (-18 - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}) = 30
\]
\[
20 + 18 + 2 \cdot \text{IIP3} = 30
\]
\[
38 + 2 \cdot \text{IIP3} = 30
\]
\[
2 \cdot \text{IIP3} = 30 - 38 = -8
\]
\[
\text{IIP3} = -4 \, \text{dBm}
\]

✅ **Answer: IIP3 ≈ –4 dBm**

Alternatively, there's a shortcut formula used in practice:

\[
\text{IIP3} = P_{\text{in}} - \frac{\Delta}{2}
\]

Plug in:
\[
\text{IIP3} = -6 - \frac{30}{2} = -6 - 15 = -21 \, \text{dBm}
\]

⚠️ Wait! This contradicts our earlier result.

Ah! Here’s the critical point:  
There are two conventions for labeling the Δ value:
- Some define Δ as the difference between desired output and IM3 output.
- But the most commonly used relation is:

\[
\Delta = 2 \cdot (\text{IIP3} - P_{\text{in}})
\]

Which rearranges to:

\[
\text{IIP3} = P_{\text{in}} + \frac{\Delta}{2}
\]

So with Δ = 30 dB, P_in = –6 dBm:

\[
\text{IIP3} = -6 + \frac{30}{2} = -6 + 15 = 9 \, \text{dBm}
\]

Wait — now we’re getting **three different answers**!

Let me clarify once and for all.

---

### ✅ Correct formula (standard in RF engineering):
For a 2-tone test:
- If the input power per tone is \( P_{\text{in}} \), 
- And the output power of each tone is \( P_{\text{out}} \),
- Then the IM3 power at output is:
  \[
  P_{\text{IM3, out}} = 3P_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}
  \]
- So the difference between the desired (tone) and IM3 power is:
  \[
  \Delta = P_{\text{out}} - P_{\text{IM3, out}} = (P_{\text{out}}) - (3P_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3})
  \]
  But \( P_{\text{out}} = G \cdot P_{\text{in}} \), so:
  \[
  \Delta = G \cdot P_{\text{in}} - 3P_{\text{in}} + 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}
  \]

From problem:
- \( P_{\text{in}} = -6 \, \text{dBm} \)
- \( P_{\text{out}} = 20 \, \text{dBm} \)
→ Gain \( G = 20 - (-6) = 26 \, \text{dB} \)

So:
\[
\Delta = 26 + (-6) - 3(-6) + 2 \cdot \text{IIP3} \quad \text{(all in dBm)}
\]
Wait — no, the gain must be applied properly.

Better approach: Use the standard relation directly:

The output IM3 difference (Δ) is related to IIP3 by:

\[
\Delta = 2 \cdot (\text{IIP3} - P_{\text{in}})
\]

This is the most widely accepted formula for 2-tone tests when the output power of the fundamental is known relative to IIP3.

Given:
- Δ = 30 dB,
- \( P_{\text{in}} = -6 \, \text{dBm} \)

Then:
\[
30 = 2 \cdot (\text{IIP3} - (-6))
\Rightarrow 30 = 2 \cdot (\text{IIP3} + 6)
\Rightarrow 15 = \text{IIP3} + 6
\Rightarrow \text{IIP3} = 9 \, \text{dBm}
\]

✅ **Final Answer: IIP3 ≈ 9 dBm**

This matches industry-standard formulas and is consistent with most RF textbooks (e.g., Razavi, Pozar).

**Therefore, the approximate Input Third-Order Intercept (IIP3) is 9 dBm.**",9.0,1.0,0.08000955000000012
Convert noise -174 dBm/Hz to W/Hz.,"To convert from dBm/Hz to W/Hz, we use the relationship between decibel-milliwatts (dBm) and watts.

### Step 1: Understand the reference
- **0 dBm = 1 milliwatt (mW) = 10⁻³ W**
- So, the formula to convert from dBm to watts is:
  
  \[
  P_{\text{W}} = 10^{\frac{\text{dBm} - 30}{10}}
  \]

This is because:
\[
\text{dBm} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{mW}}}{1 \text{ mW}}\right)
\Rightarrow P_{\text{mW}} = 10^{\frac{\text{dBm}}{10}}, \quad P_{\text{W}} = 10^{\frac{\text{dBm}}{10}} \times 10^{-3}
= 10^{\frac{\text{dBm} - 30}{10}}
\]

### Step 2: Apply to -174 dBm/Hz

\[
P_{\text{W/Hz}} = 10^{\frac{-174 - 30}{10}} = 10^{\frac{-204}{10}} = 10^{-20.4}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the result

\[
10^{-20.4} = 10^{-20} \times 10^{-0.4} = 10^{-20} \times 0.3981 \approx 3.981 \times 10^{-21} \text{ W/Hz}

- Velocity: \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Angle: \( \theta = 30^\circ \)
- Doppler shift formula:  
  \[
  f_D = \frac{v \cos\theta}{\lambda}
  \]

### Step 1: Find the wavelength \( \lambda \)

The wavelength is related to frequency by:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c}
\]
where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.8 \times 10^9} = \frac{3}{18} = 0.1667 \, \text{m}
\]

So, \( \lambda \approx 0.1667 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 2: Compute \( f_D \)

\[
f_D = \frac{v \cos\theta}{\lambda}
= \frac{20 \cdot \cos(30^\circ)}{0.1667}
\]

We know:
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660
\]

So:
\[
f_D = \frac{20 \cdot 0.8660}{0.1667} = \frac{17.32}{0.1667} \approx 103.9 \, \text{Hz}

### Step 1: Find the number of levels (L)

The formula given is:

\[
L = \frac{\text{range}}{\Delta}
\]

Range = 2 V  
Δ = 1/64 V

\[
L = \frac{2}{1/64} = 2 \times 64 = 128
\]

So, there are **128 quantization levels**.

---

### Step 2: Find bits per sample

In PCM, the number of bits per sample \( b \) is determined by:

\[
b = \log_2(L)
\]

\[
b = \log_2(128) = 7

✅ So, **7 bits per sample**

Laplacian noise detector: noiseless outputs 0 or A with equal priors and noise pdf f(n)=(1/(2λ))exp(-|n|/λ). Find optimal threshold V_d.,"To find the optimal threshold \( V_d \) for a Laplacian noise detector, we consider a binary hypothesis testing problem where:

- Under \( H_0 \): The output is noiseless and equals 0.
- Under \( H_1 \): The output is noiseless and equals \( A \).

The noise \( n \) is Laplacian with PDF:
\[
f(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|n|/\lambda}
\]

So the observed signal \( y \) is:
- \( y = 0 + n \) under \( H_0 \)
- \( y = A + n \) under \( H_1 \)

Assume equal priors: \( P(H_0) = P(H_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)

We want to find the **optimal decision rule** (threshold \( V_d \)) that minimizes the probability of error.

---

### Step 1: Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)
Let \( f_0(y) = f(y | H_0) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y|/\lambda} \)

Let \( f_1(y) = f(y | H_1) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda} \)

The likelihood ratio is:
\[
\Lambda(y) = \frac{f_1(y)}{f_0(y)} = \frac{e^{-|y - A|/\lambda}}{e^{-|y|/\lambda}} = e^{(|y| - |y - A|)/\lambda}
\]

The LRT decides \( H_1 \) if \( \Lambda(y) > \eta \), where \( \eta = \frac{P(H_0)}{P(H_1)} = 1 \), since priors are equal.

So the optimal decision rule is:
\[
\text{Decide } H_1 \iff \Lambda(y) > 1
\]
\[
\iff |y| - |y - A| > 0
\]
\[
\iff |y| > |y - A|
\]

This inequality defines the decision region for \( H_1 \). The boundary between the two regions — where \( |y| = |y - A| \) — gives us the optimal threshold \( V_d \).

---

### Step 2: Solve \( |y| = |y - A| \)

This equation holds when the distance from \( y \) to 0 equals the distance from \( y \) to \( A \). Geometrically, this occurs at the midpoint:
\[
y = \frac{A}{2}
\]

Because:
- The set of points equidistant from 0 and A on the real line is \( y = A/2 \).

Thus, the optimal threshold is:
\[
V_d = \frac{A}{2}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{V_d = \frac{A}{2}}

A DSB-SC signal is centered at f_c=1 MHz and message bandwidth is 12 kHz. Specify positive-frequency passband.,"For a DSB-SC (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier) signal:

- The carrier frequency is \( f_c = 1 \, \text{MHz} \)
- The message bandwidth is \( B = 12 \, \text{kHz} \)

In DSB-SC modulation:
- The spectrum consists of two sidebands: upper sideband (USB) and lower sideband (LSB)
- Each sideband extends from \( f_c - B \) to \( f_c + B \)

So the full passband (both positive and negative frequencies) is:
\[
[f_c - B, f_c + B] = [1\,\text{MHz} - 12\,\text{kHz}, 1\,\text{MHz} + 12\,\text{kHz}] = [988\,\text{kHz}, 1012\,\text{kHz}]

Compute required modulation order to fit R_b=240 kbit/s into baseband bandwidth B=120 kHz with α=0.25. Use R_b=2B log2(M)/(1+α). Find minimum power-of-2 M.,"We are given:

- Bit rate: \( R_b = 240 \) kbit/s  
- Baseband bandwidth: \( B = 120 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor: \( \alpha = 0.25 \)  
- Formula:  
  \[
  R_b = \frac{2B \log_2(M)}{1 + \alpha}
  \]

We need to find the **minimum power-of-2** value of \( M \) (i.e., \( M = 2^k \)) that satisfies this equation.

---

### Step 1: Plug values into the formula

\[
240 = \frac{2 \times 120 \times \log_2(M)}{1 + 0.25}
\]

Simplify denominator:

\[
1 + 0.25 = 1.25
\]

So:

\[
240 = \frac{240 \log_2(M)}{1.25}
\]

Multiply both sides by 1.25:

\[
240 \times 1.25 = 240 \log_2(M)
\]
\[
300 = 240 \log_2(M)
\]

Divide both sides by 240:

\[
\log_2(M) = \frac{300}{240} = 1.25
\]

Now solve for \( M \):

\[
M = 2^{1.25} = 2^{5/4} = \sqrt[4]{2^5} = \sqrt[4]{32}
\]

Calculate numerically:

\[
2^{1.25} \approx 2.378
\]

So \( M \approx 2.378 \)

But \( M \) must be a **power of 2**, i.e., \( M = 2, 4, 8, 16, \dots \), and we want the **smallest such M** that allows us to fit at least 240 kbit/s in the given bandwidth.

This means we must choose the **smallest power of 2 ≥ 2.378**, which is:

\[
M = 4 \quad (\text{since } 2^2 = 4 > 2.378)
\]

Let’s verify with \( M = 4 \):

\[
R_b = \frac{2 \times 120 \times \log_2(4)}{1.25} = \frac{240 \times 2}{1.25} = \frac{480}{1.25} = 384 \text{ kbit/s}
\]

That’s more than 240 kbit/s — so it fits!

What about \( M = 2 \)? That would give:

\[
R_b = \frac{240 \times \log_2(2)}{1.25} = \frac{240 \times 1}{1.25} = 192 \text{ kbit/s}
\]

Too low — doesn't meet the required 240 kbit/s.

✅ So the **minimum power-of-2 M** that supports at least 240 kbit/s under these constraints is:

A bandpass channel has bandwidth 3000 Hz and uses binary NRZ for 2PSK. Compute spectral efficiency η.,"To compute the spectral efficiency η for a bandpass channel using binary NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) modulation with 2PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), we proceed as follows:

---

### **Given:**
- Bandwidth of the channel, \( B = 3000 \) Hz  
- Modulation: Binary NRZ + 2PSK  

---

### **Step 1: Understand what 2PSK means**
2PSK (also called BPSK - Binary Phase Shift Keying) is a digital modulation scheme where:
- Each symbol represents **1 bit**.
- The signal has two phases (e.g., 0° and 180°).
- So, **bits per symbol = 1**

This implies the **symbol rate (baud rate)** \( R_s \) equals the **bit rate** \( R_b \).

---

### **Step 2: Spectral Efficiency Definition**
Spectral efficiency \( \eta \) is defined as:

\[
\eta = \frac{R_b}{B} \quad \text{(in bits/second/Hz)}
\]

Where:
- \( R_b \) = bit rate in bps  
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz

---

### **Step 3: Compute Bit Rate from Bandwidth**

For a **baseband** system, the maximum bit rate without ISI (using Nyquist criterion) is:
\[
R_b = 2B
\]
But here, it's a **bandpass channel**, and we are using **2PSK**, which is typically implemented using a **raised cosine filter** or similar to avoid interference.

However, for standard **2PSK** in a bandpass channel, the **minimum required bandwidth** for transmitting \( R_b \) bits/sec is approximately:
\[
B \approx R_b \quad \text{(for 2PSK with no filtering beyond basic shaping)}
\]
This is because 2PSK has a passband bandwidth equal to the symbol rate when using rectangular pulses — but real systems use pulse shaping (like root-raised cosine) to reduce bandwidth.

However, in many textbook problems, especially when not specifying a pulse shape, it’s common to assume that for 2PSK:
\[
\text{Minimum bandwidth } B = R_b \quad \text{(i.e., 1 bit/symbol → 1 Hz per bit)}
\]

So:
\[
R_b = B = 3000 \text{ bps}

Thus,
\[
\eta = \frac{R_b}{B} = \frac{3000}{3000} = 1 \text{ bit/s/Hz}

"Coherence bandwidth threshold. If coherence bandwidth B_c=30 kHz, what minimum spacing Δf_th should exceed to be approximately uncorrelated?","To determine the minimum frequency spacing Δf_th that should exceed for signals to be approximately uncorrelated, we use the relationship between coherence bandwidth and frequency correlation:

The coherence bandwidth \( B_c \) is the maximum frequency difference over which the channel response remains highly correlated. For frequencies spaced by more than \( B_c \), the channel responses are approximately uncorrelated.

Thus, the threshold spacing \( \Delta f_{\text{th}} \) should exceed the coherence bandwidth:

\[
\Delta f_{\text{th}} > B_c
\]

Given:
\[
B_c = 30 \text{ kHz}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\Delta f_{\text{th}} > 30 \text{ kHz}
\]

"AM synchronous detection gain factor. For modulation index μ=0.6, compute G_AM=μ^2/(2+μ^2) (envelope) and compare to coherent DSB-SC gain 2. Give ratio in dB.","We are asked to compute the gain factor for AM synchronous detection (envelope detection in this context), compare it to coherent DSB-SC gain, and give the ratio in dB.

Given:
- Modulation index \( \mu = 0.6 \)
- AM synchronous detection gain:  
  \[
  G_{AM} = \frac{\mu^2}{2 + \mu^2}
  \]
- Coherent DSB-SC gain: \( G_{DSB} = 2 \)

---

### Step 1: Compute \( G_{AM} \)

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{(0.6)^2}{2 + (0.6)^2} = \frac{0.36}{2 + 0.36} = \frac{0.36}{2.36}
\]

\[
G_{AM} \approx 0.1525
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute the ratio of gains

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{G_{AM}}{G_{DSB}} = \frac{0.1525}{2} = 0.07625
\]

---

### Step 3: Convert ratio to dB

Use the formula:

\[
\text{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(\text{Ratio}) = 10 \log_{10}(0.07625)
\]

Calculate:

\[
\log_{10}(0.07625) \approx -1.118
\]

\[
\text{dB} = 10 \times (-1.118) = -11.18 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
- AM synchronous detection gain: \( G_{AM} \approx 0.1525 \)
- Ratio of AM gain to DSB-SC gain: \( \approx 0.07625 \)
- In dB: **–11.18 dB**

This means AM synchronous detection is about **11.18 dB weaker** than coherent DSB-SC detection for \( \mu = 0.6 \).",10.6,0.0,0.07235210000000011
A bandpass channel has bandwidth 3000 Hz and uses binary NRZ for 2PSK. Compute spectral efficiency η.,"To compute the spectral efficiency \( \eta \) for a bandpass channel using binary NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) signaling with 2PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), we follow these steps:

---

### **Given:**
- Bandwidth \( B = 3000 \, \text{Hz} \)
- Modulation: 2PSK (also called BPSK — Binary Phase Shift Keying)
- Line coding: Binary NRZ (which is used for baseband representation; in bandpass, it's typically modulated via carrier)

---

### **Step 1: Understand 2PSK (BPSK) Spectral Efficiency**

In digital communications, spectral efficiency \( \eta \) is defined as:

\[
\eta = \frac{R}{B}
\]

where:
- \( R \) = bit rate (in bits per second)
- \( B \) = bandwidth (in Hz)

For **2PSK (BPSK)**, each symbol carries **1 bit** (since there are 2 symbols: 0° and 180° phase).

The **minimum required bandwidth** for BPSK (with ideal rectangular pulse shaping or square-root raised cosine) is:

\[
B_{\text{min}} = R_b
\]

This means the **bit rate equals the bandwidth** when using BPSK with no excess bandwidth (i.e., Nyquist criterion met):

\[
R_b = B
\]

So:

\[
\eta = \frac{R_b}{B} = \frac{B}{B} = 1 \, \text{bit/s/Hz}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\eta = 1 \, \text{bit/s/Hz}
\]

This is the maximum spectral efficiency achievable with BPSK under ideal conditions. It is not affected by the use of NRZ line coding, since that is part of the baseband shaping — the key factor is the modulation (2PSK), which maps 1 bit per symbol.",0.5,0.3,0.020790500000000007
"A QPSK link needs R_b=9600 bit/s in a 3100 Hz channel. Using raised-cosine α=1, does it fit?","To determine whether a QPSK link with bit rate \( R_b = 9600 \) bit/s can fit in a 3100 Hz channel using a raised-cosine filter with roll-off factor \( \alpha = 1 \), we need to calculate the required **bandwidth** for the signal.

---

### Step 1: Understand QPSK and Symbol Rate
In QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), each symbol carries **2 bits**.  
So, the symbol rate \( R_s \) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{R_b}{2} = \frac{9600}{2} = 4800 \text{ symbols per second}
\]

---

### Step 2: Bandwidth of Raised-Cosine Filter
The bandwidth \( B \) for a raised-cosine filter is given by:

\[
B = R_s (1 + \alpha)
\]

Given:
- \( R_s = 4800 \) Baud
- \( \alpha = 1 \)

So:

\[
B = 4800 \times (1 + 1) = 4800 \times 2 = 9600 \text{ Hz}
\]

---

### Step 3: Compare with Available Channel Bandwidth
Available channel bandwidth = 3100 Hz  
Required bandwidth = 9600 Hz

Since \( 9600 \, \text{Hz} > 3100 \, \text{Hz} \), the signal **does not fit** in the channel.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**No**, the QPSK link with \( R_b = 9600 \) bit/s and \( \alpha = 1 \) does **not fit** in a 3100 Hz channel — it requires 9600 Hz of bandwidth.",No,0.8,0.028211600000000007
"Synchronization word design (m=0). Bit rate R=200 bit/s, equiprobable bits, false sync at most once per month (30 days). Find minimum sync length n using P_f=2^{-n} and expected trials RT.","We are asked to design a synchronization word (sync word) for a digital communication system with the following specifications:

- Bit rate \( R = 200 \) bits/second  
- Equiprobable bits (so each bit is 0 or 1 with equal probability \( 0.5 \))  
- False synchronization should occur at most once per month (30 days)  
- Synchronization word length: \( n \) (to be found)  
- Probability of false sync: \( P_f = 2^{-n} \)  
- Expected number of trials: \( R \cdot T \), where \( T \) is the time duration over which we expect one false sync

---

### Step 1: Define ""False Sync""
A false sync occurs when a random sequence of \( n \) bits happens to match the sync word by chance — even though it's not the real sync. This is modeled as:
\[
P_f = 2^{-n}
\]
Because each bit is independent and equiprobable, the probability that a random \( n \)-bit sequence matches a specific sync word is \( 2^{-n} \).

---

### Step 2: Expected Trials Between False Syncs
Let’s compute how many bit transmissions occur between expected false syncs.

The expected number of **independent trials** (i.e., opportunities for false sync) before a false sync occurs is:
\[
E[\text{trials}] = \frac{1}{P_f} = 2^n
\]

Each trial corresponds to a possible starting position in the bitstream where a sync word of length \( n \) could be tested.

But we need to relate this to time and bit rate.

Since the bit rate is \( R = 200 \) bits/sec, the number of bits per second is 200.

So, in \( T \) seconds, the total number of bits transmitted is \( RT \).  
The number of possible \( n \)-bit sliding windows (i.e., possible sync positions) in \( RT \) bits is approximately \( RT - n + 1 \approx RT \) for large \( RT \).

Thus, the expected number of **opportunities** for false sync in time \( T \) is:
\[
RT
\]
(Each bit can start a new sync test, but due to overlap, the exact number is \( RT - n + 1 \), which we approximate as \( RT \) since \( n \ll RT \))

Then, the expected number of false syncs in time \( T \) is:
\[
E[\text{false syncs}] = (RT) \cdot P_f = RT \cdot 2^{-n}
\]

We want this expectation to be ≤ 1 per month (30 days).

---

### Step 3: Set Up Inequality

We want:
\[
RT \cdot 2^{-n} \leq 1
\]
With:
- \( R = 200 \) bits/sec  
- \( T = 30 \) days = \( 30 \times 24 \times 3600 \) seconds  
  → \( T = 2,592,000 \) seconds

Substitute:
\[
200 \times 2,592,000 \cdot 2^{-n} \leq 1
\]
\[
518,400,000 \cdot 2^{-n} \leq 1
\]

Solve for \( n \):
\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{518,400,000}
\]
Take log base 2:
\[
-n \leq \log_2 \left( \frac{1}{518,400,000} \right)
\]
\[
n \geq \log_2 (518,400,000)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(518,400,000) \):

First, note:
- \( 2^{29} = 536,870,912 \)  
- \( 2^{28} = 268,435,456 \)

So:
- \( 518,400,000 \) is between \( 2^{28} \) and \( 2^{29} \)

Compute:
\[
\log_2(518,400,000) \approx \log_{10}(518,400,000) / \log_{10}(2)
\]

- \( \log_{10}(518,400,000) \approx \log_{10}(5.184 \times 10^8) = 8 + \log_{10}(5.184) \approx 8 + 0.7147 = 8.7147 \)
- \( \log_{10}(2) \approx 0.3010 \)

So:
\[
\log_2(518,400,000) \approx \frac{8.7147}{0.3010} \approx 28.95
\]

Therefore:
\[
n \geq 28.95 \Rightarrow n = 29
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Minimum sync length \( n = 29 \)** bits

This ensures that false synchronization occurs on average no more than once per month (30 days) at 200 bit/s with equiprobable bits.

---

### Additional Note:
Expected number of trials between false syncs is:
\[
E[\text{trials}] = 2^n = 2^{29} \approx 536,870,912 \text{ bits}
\]
At \( R = 200 \) bits/sec, this corresponds to:
\[
T = \frac{536,870,912}{200} = 2,684,354.56 \text{ seconds} \approx 31 \text{ days}
\]
Which is just above 30 days — so \( n = 29 \) gives exactly what we want (≤ once/month).  
If we tried \( n = 28 \), we’d get \( 2^{28} = 268,435,456 \) bits → ~13.4 days → too frequent!  
So **n = 29 is the minimum required**.",29.0,1.0,0.04130365000000004
"Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ=60°. If ideal (φ=0) requires E_b/N_0=8 dB for a target BER, what additional SNR penalty (dB) is needed due to phase offset, assuming decision variable scales by cosφ?","We are told that ideal BPSK (with φ = 0°) requires \( E_b/N_0 = 8 \, \text{dB} \) to achieve a target BER.

Now, with a phase offset \( \phi = 60^\circ \), the decision variable scales by \( \cos\phi \). This means the effective signal amplitude at the receiver is reduced by a factor of \( \cos(60^\circ) \).

Let’s compute the penalty:

### Step 1: Compute \( \cos(60^\circ) \)
\[
\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5
\]

This implies that the received signal energy per bit (as seen by the detector) is reduced by a factor of \( 0.5 \), i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is effectively halved in terms of power — because power scales with the square of amplitude.

So:
- Original SNR for ideal case: \( E_b/N_0 = 8 \, \text{dB} \)
- With phase offset, the effective \( E_b/N_0 \) becomes:
  \[
  (E_b/N_0)_{\text{eff}} = (E_b/N_0) \times (\cos\phi)^2 = 8 \, \text{dB} \times (0.5)^2 = 8 \, \text{dB} \times 0.25
  \]

### Step 2: Convert to linear scale and back
First, convert 8 dB to linear:
\[
(E_b/N_0)_{\text{linear}} = 10^{8/10} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096
\]

Multiply by \( 0.25 \):
\[
(E_b/N_0)_{\text{eff, linear}} = 6.3096 \times 0.25 = 1.5774
\]

Convert back to dB:
\[
(E_b/N_0)_{\text{eff, dB}} = 10 \log_{10}(1.5774) \approx 1.98 \, \text{dB}
\]

So, the effective \( E_b/N_0 \) needed drops from 8 dB to about 2 dB — but that can’t be right intuitively. Wait — we’re misinterpreting the problem.

Actually, it's the opposite: **the system now performs worse**, so to maintain the same BER, you need a higher \( E_b/N_0 \) than before.

The key is:  
- The decision variable (i.e., the signal component at the detector) is scaled by \( \cos\phi \).
- Since the noise remains unchanged, the SNR is scaled by \( \cos^2\phi \).
- So if your original required \( E_b/N_0 \) was 8 dB, and now the signal is weaker, you must increase \( E_b/N_0 \) to compensate.

Thus, the new required \( E_b/N_0 \) is:
\[
(E_b/N_0)_{\text{new}} = (E_b/N_0)_{\text{ideal}} / \cos^2\phi
\]

Because the SNR is reduced by a factor of \( \cos^2\phi \), to keep BER constant, you must boost the input SNR by the inverse factor.

So:
\[
(E_b/N_0)_{\text{new}} = 8 \, \text{dB} / \cos^2(60^\circ) = 8 \, \text{dB} / 0.25
\]

But this is not correct — you cannot simply divide dB values directly. You must convert to linear scale first.

### Correct Approach:

Let \( \gamma = E_b/N_0 \) in linear scale.

Original required \( \gamma_{\text{ideal}} = 10^{8/10} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096 \)

With phase offset, the effective SNR becomes:
\[
\gamma_{\text{eff}} = \gamma_{\text{ideal}} \cdot \cos^2\phi = 6.3096 \times 0.25 = 1.5774
\]

To achieve the same BER, we must now have \( \gamma_{\text{new}} = 6.3096 \) (same as before), meaning that the actual \( E_b/N_0 \) needs to be increased to compensate for the loss.

So the additional SNR needed is:
\[
\Delta \gamma = \gamma_{\text{ideal}} / \cos^2\phi = 6.3096 / 0.25 = 25.2384
\]

Convert back to dB:
\[
\Delta \gamma_{\text{dB}} = 10 \log_{10}(25.2384) \approx 14.02 \, \text{dB}
\]

Wait — that’s not right either. Let’s step back.

The **penalty** is how much more SNR you need compared to the ideal case.

Since the signal is attenuated by a factor of \( \cos\phi \), the SNR (which is proportional to signal power) is degraded by \( \cos^2\phi \). To restore the same SNR, you need to increase the input \( E_b/N_0 \) by a factor of \( 1/\cos^2\phi \).

So the required increase in \( E_b/N_0 \) is:
\[
\text{Penalty in dB} = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{\cos^2\phi} \right) = -10 \log_{10}(\cos^2\phi) = -20 \log_{10}(\cos\phi)
\]

Plug in \( \phi = 60^\circ \), \( \cos\phi = 0.5 \):

\[
\text{Penalty} = -20 \log_{10}(0.5) = -20 \times (-0.3010) = 6.02 \, \text{dB}
\]

✅ That’s the correct answer!

### Final Answer:
**6.02 dB**

This is the additional SNR penalty due to the 60° phase offset — because the signal amplitude is halved, the SNR drops by 6 dB (since power scales as square), and thus you must add 6 dB to the required \( E_b/N_0 \) to maintain the same BER.",6.02,0.0,0.04838055000000005

For large \( x \), it can be approximated using:

Let’s compute:

- \( x = 6.3246 \)
- \( x^2 / 2 = (6.3246)^2 / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20 \)
- So \( e^{-x^2/2} = e^{-20} \approx 2.061 \times 10^{-9} \)

Now, compute the coefficient:

\[

### Step 1: Set up the equation

\]

Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}

### Step 2: Use inverse Q-function or standard values

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:

- \( Q(3.29) \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \)
- \( Q(3.30) \approx 4.8 \times 10^{-4} \)

Interpolating between these:

- At \( x = 3.29 \), \( Q(x) = 5.1 \times 10^{-4} \)
- At \( x = 3.30 \), \( Q(x) = 4.8 \times 10^{-4} \)

We want \( Q(x) = 5.0 \times 10^{-4} \). This is halfway between 5.1 and 4.8, so approximately:

\[

- \( R_b = 20 \, \text{kbit/s} = 20 \times 10^3 \, \text{bit/s} \)

Now plug in the values:

\[

First, multiply the numbers:

\[
9.10 \times 20 = 182
\]

Then handle the powers of 10:

\[

A transmitter has P_t=10 mW and required received power is 10^{-12} W. Find allowable path loss in dB.,"To find the allowable path loss in dB, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Path Loss (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_t}{P_r} \right)

Compute BER for coherent orthogonal BFSK at E_b/N0=12 dB.,"To compute the Bit Error Rate (BER) for **coherent orthogonal Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK)** at \( E_b/N_0 = 12 \, \text{dB} \), we use the standard analytical expression:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{12/10} = 10^{1.2} \approx 15.8489
\]

### Step 2: Plug into BER formula
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left( \sqrt{15.8489} \right)

\[
\sqrt{15.8489} \approx 3.981

Now compute:
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}(3.981)

Using a calculator or software (like MATLAB, Python, or tables):

- \( \operatorname{erfc}(3.981) \approx 3.04 \times 10^{-7} \)

"Compute MAP threshold for 2PSK with P1=0.9, P2=0.1, A=0.5, N0=0.2.","To compute the **MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) threshold** for a 2-PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) system, we need to determine the decision threshold that minimizes the probability of error given the prior probabilities and noise statistics.

---

### Given:
- \( P_1 = 0.9 \): Prior probability of symbol 1 (say, \( s_1 = +A \))
- \( P_2 = 0.1 \): Prior probability of symbol 2 (say, \( s_2 = -A \))
- \( A = 0.5 \): Signal amplitude
- \( N_0 = 0.2 \): Noise power spectral density

The received signal is:
\[
r = s_i + n, \quad \text{where } n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{N_0}{2})
\]

For 2-PSK, the two possible transmit symbols are:
- \( s_1 = +A = +0.5 \)
- \( s_2 = -A = -0.5 \)

---

### MAP Decision Rule:
We decide in favor of \( s_1 \) if:
\[
\frac{P(r|s_1)}{P(r|s_2)} \geq \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]
This simplifies to comparing the likelihood ratio to the ratio of priors.

Taking logs (log-likelihood ratio):
\[
\log \left( \frac{P(r|s_1)}{P(r|s_2)} \right) \geq \log \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)
\]

Since \( r \sim \mathcal{N}(s_i, \sigma^2) \), with \( \sigma^2 = \frac{N_0}{2} \), the log-likelihood ratio becomes:
\[
\frac{2A}{N_0} r \geq \log \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)
\]

Solving for \( r \), the threshold \( \gamma \) is:
\[
\gamma = \frac{N_0}{2A} \log \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)
\]

Plug in the values:
- \( A = 0.5 \)
- \( N_0 = 0.2 \)
- \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{0.1}{0.9} = \frac{1}{9} \)

So:
\[
\gamma = \frac{0.2}{2 \times 0.5} \cdot \log\left(\frac{1}{9}\right)
= \frac{0.2}{1} \cdot (-\log 9)
= 0.2 \cdot (-\ln 9)
\]

Now calculate:
- \( \ln 9 = \ln(3^2) = 2 \ln 3 \approx 2 \times 1.0986 = 2.1972 \)

Thus:
\[
\gamma = 0.2 \times (-2.1972) = -0.43944
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**MAP threshold \( \gamma = -0.4394 \)**

This means:  
- If \( r \geq -0.4394 \), decide \( s_1 = +0.5 \)  
- If \( r < -0.4394 \), decide \( s_2 = -0.5 \)

This threshold accounts for the unequal priors (since \( P_1 = 0.9 \) is much more likely than \( P_2 = 0.1 \)), shifting the decision boundary toward the less probable symbol (to reduce expected error).",0.1099,0.7,0.03065210000000001

### Given:
- Sampling frequency, \( f_s = 10 \) kHz = 10,000 samples/second  
- Number of quantization levels, \( L = 64 \)

---

### Step 1: Bits per sample
The number of bits per sample is determined by how many bits are needed to represent \( L \) discrete levels.

\[
\text{Bits per sample} = \log_2(L)

\[

"In coherent demodulation of an SSB signal, message bandwidth is 3 kHz and one-sided noise PSD is n_0=2×10^{-6} W/Hz. If received signal power is S_i=1 mW, compute input SNR S_i/N_i.","To compute the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for coherent demodulation of an SSB (Single Sideband) signal, we follow these steps:

---

### Given:
- Message bandwidth: \( B = 3 \ \text{kHz} = 3000 \ \text{Hz} \)
- One-sided noise power spectral density: \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{W/Hz} \)
- Received signal power: \( S_i = 1 \ \text{mW} = 10^{-3} \ \text{W} \)

---

### Step 1: Compute Noise Power at Input
In coherent demodulation of SSB, the noise is filtered by a bandpass filter that matches the message bandwidth. Since it's one-sided noise PSD and we're dealing with SSB (which occupies only one sideband), the total input noise power is:

\[
N_i = n_0 \cdot B
\]

Substitute values:

\[
N_i = (2 \times 10^{-6} \ \text{W/Hz}) \times (3000 \ \text{Hz}) = 6 \times 10^{-3} \ \text{W}
\]

So, \( N_i = 6 \ \text{mW} \)

---

### Step 2: Compute Input SNR

\[
\text{SNR}_i = \frac{S_i}{N_i} = \frac{10^{-3}}{6 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1}{6}

\[
\text{SNR}_i = 0.1667 \ \text{(or approximately } 16.67\% \text{)}

- Outage probability \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.5\% = 0.005 \)
- Threshold power \( P_{\text{th}} = 15 \) dBm
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing \( \sigma = 4 \) dB

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

This is a classic problem in wireless communications involving **log-normal fading**.

The received signal power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where \( \mu \) is the mean of the logarithm of the received power (in dB), and \( \sigma = 4 \) dB.

The outage probability is defined as:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < P_{\text{th}})
\]

In terms of the standard normal variable \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \), this becomes:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

We want to find the required mean \( \mu \) such that:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{15 - \mu}{4} \right) = 0.005
\]

---

### Solve for \( \mu \):

1. Find the z-score corresponding to \( \Phi(z) = 0.005 \):

From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF:
\[
z = \Phi^{-1}(0.005) \approx -2.576
\]

2. Now solve:
\[
\frac{15 - \mu}{4} = -2.576
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:
\[
15 - \mu = -10.304
\]

Solve for \( \mu \):
\[
\mu = 15 + 10.304 = 25.304 \text{ dBm}

Calculate:

\[
\frac{0.15}{4\pi} = \frac{0.15}{12.5664} \approx 0.01194

- Required output SNR = 30 dB  
- Noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)  
- Message bandwidth \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)  
- Frequency deviation \( \Delta f = 15 \, \text{kHz} \)  
- Discriminator gain: \( G_{FM} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) \)  
- Bandwidth of FM signal: \( B_{FM} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) \)

We are to find the required **input signal power** \( S_i \).

---

### Step 1: Convert required output SNR from dB to linear scale
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = 10^{30/10} = 10^3 = 1000
\]

This is the **output signal-to-noise ratio** after demodulation.

---

### Step 2: Use the FM SNR improvement formula

The output SNR in FM systems is related to the input SNR by:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = G_{FM} \cdot \text{SNR}_{\text{in}}
\]
Where:
- \( G_{FM} \) is the **figure of merit** (gain) of the FM system.
- \( \text{SNR}_{\text{in}} = \frac{S_i}{N_{\text{in}}} \), with \( N_{\text{in}} = n_0 \cdot B_{FM} \)

So,
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = G_{FM} \cdot \frac{S_i}{n_0 \cdot B_{FM}}
\]

Solving for \( S_i \):
\[
S_i = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} \cdot n_0 \cdot B_{FM}}{G_{FM}}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate β (modulation index)
\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} = \frac{15 \, \text{kHz}}{5 \, \text{kHz}} = 3
\]

---

### Step 4: Compute \( G_{FM} \)
\[
G_{FM} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) = 3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot (1 + 3) = 3 \cdot 9 \cdot 4 = 108
\]

---

### Step 5: Compute \( B_{FM} \)
\[
B_{FM} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2(15 + 5) = 40 \, \text{kHz} = 4 \times 10^4 \, \text{Hz}

- \( \mu = 0.4 \)

We are to find the impulse magnitudes (i.e., Fourier transform magnitude at specific frequencies) in the frequency domain \( S(f) \), specifically at:
- \( \pm f_c \)
- \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Use trigonometric identity
Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)]
\]

Apply this to expand \( s(t) \):

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

Now apply the identity to the second term:

\[
= A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \right]
\]

So the time-domain signal becomes:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t)
\]

This is a sum of cosine terms — each corresponds to an impulse in the Fourier transform.

---

### Step 2: Take Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform of \( \cos(2\pi f_0 t) \) is:

\[
\mathcal{F}\{\cos(2\pi f_0 t)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0) \right]
\]

Apply this to each term:

1. For \( A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) \):
   \[
   \Rightarrow \frac{A_c}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c) \right]

2. For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) \):
   \[
   \Rightarrow \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m)) \right]
   \]

3. For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \):
   \[
   \Rightarrow \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c - f_m)) \right]

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)

Convert to linear:
\[

From the list:
- γ = 10 → not outage ✅
- γ = 3.162 → not outage ✅
- γ = 1 → **not less than 1**, so **not outage** ✅

- A series inductor \( L = 120 \, \text{nH} \) is added.

We are to find the **new input impedance** after adding the inductor in series.

### Step 1: Compute inductive reactance
The reactance of an inductor is:

\[
X_L = \omega L = 2\pi f L
\]

Given:
- \( f = 100 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( L = 120 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{H} \)

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]

Given:
- \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10 \)

Step-by-step:

1. Compute the argument of the Q-function:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623
\]

2. Evaluate the Q-function at 3.1623:
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

You can compute this numerically or use a standard table or calculator.

Using a scientific calculator or Python (e.g., `scipy.special.erfc`), recall:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{2}}\right)
\]

So:
\[
Q(3.1623) = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left(\frac{3.1623}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}(2.236)
\]

Now compute:
- \( \operatorname{erfc}(2.236) \approx 0.001297 \) (from tables or numerical computation)

- Desired total users = 100,000  

We need to find the **cell area** (in km²) required to support 100,000 users.

---

### Step 1: Find how many cells are needed
If each cell supports 150 users:

\[
\text{Number of cells} = \frac{\text{Total users}}{\text{Users per cell}} = \frac{100,000}{150} = \frac{1000}{1.5} = 666.\overline{6}

\[
\text{Cell area} = \frac{\text{City area}}{\text{Number of cells}} = \frac{225}{666.\overline{6}} = \frac{225}{\frac{1000}{1.5}} = \frac{225 \times 1.5}{1000} = \frac{337.5}{1000} = 0.3375 \, \text{km}^2

"Noise power in band. Two-sided PSD N0/2=2×10^{-12} W/Hz, bandpass filter equivalent noise bandwidth B=50 kHz (one-sided around carrier). Compute total noise power passed (assume both sidebands, total bandwidth 2B).","We are given:

- Two-sided power spectral density (PSD):  
  \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

- Bandpass filter equivalent noise bandwidth:  
  \( B = 50 \, \text{kHz} \) (one-sided around carrier)

- The total bandwidth of the signal is \( 2B \), covering both sidebands.

We are asked to compute the **total noise power passed** by the filter.

---

### Step-by-step:

The two-sided PSD is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \). This means that:
- The noise power per Hz in each sideband is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \)
- But note: this is already the **two-sided** representation — that is, the total noise power across the full frequency range is distributed symmetrically.

However, in many contexts, especially with bandpass filters, it's common to define one-sided noise power as \( N_0 \), and then the two-sided is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \). So here, we are told directly:

\[
\text{Two-sided PSD} = \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

Therefore, we can solve for \( N_0 \):

\[
N_0 = 4 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

But wait — actually, we may not need to find \( N_0 \). Since the two-sided PSD is given as \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \), we can work directly with that.

Now, the filter has an equivalent noise bandwidth of \( B = 50 \, \text{kHz} \) **one-sided**, meaning it effectively integrates over a bandwidth of \( 2B = 100 \, \text{kHz} \) (since both sidebands are included).

In general, the total noise power passed is:

\[
P_{\text{noise}} = (\text{two-sided PSD}) \times (\text{total bandwidth})
\]

Why? Because the two-sided PSD gives the power per Hz in both positive and negative frequencies. When filtering a bandpass signal, you're passing a total bandwidth of \( 2B \), so:

\[
P_{\text{noise}} = \left( \frac{N_0}{2} \right) \times (2B)
\]

Substitute values:

- \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- \( 2B = 2 \times 50 \times 10^3 = 100 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \)

So:

\[
P_{\text{noise}} = (2 \times 10^{-12}) \times (100 \times 10^3) = 2 \times 10^{-12} \times 10^5 = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{W}

"For Gray-coded 16-QAM, require p_b≈10^{-3} using p_b≈(3/4)Q(\sqrt{4γ_b/5}). Find E_b/N_0 in dB.","We are given:

- A Gray-coded 16-QAM system.
- Required bit error rate: \( p_b \approx 10^{-3} \)
- Approximate bit error probability formula:
  \[
  p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right)
  \]
  
Our goal: Find \( E_b/N_0 \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Understand the formula

The given formula is an approximation for the bit error rate of Gray-coded 16-QAM. Here:

- \( \gamma_b = E_b/N_0 \) (in linear scale, not dB)
- \( Q(x) \) is the standard Q-function: \( Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt \)

So we solve:
\[
\frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = 10^{-3}
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for the Q-function argument

Divide both sides by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{4}{3000} = \frac{1}{750} \approx 0.001333...
\]

Now find the value of \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 0.001333 \).

We can use known values or approximate using inverse Q-function (or a calculator):

From standard Q-tables or using MATLAB/Python:

- \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.0013499 \)
- \( Q(3.01) \approx 0.001306 \)

So interpolate between 3.0 and 3.01:

- \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.00135 \)
- Target: \( 0.001333 \), so slightly less than 3.0

Let’s compute more precisely using a better estimate:

Use Python or a calculator to find \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 0.001333 \)

Using scipy.stats.norm.cdf:

```python
from scipy.stats import norm
x = norm.ppf(1 - 0.001333)
```

Or directly:

```python
from scipy.special import erfc
import numpy as np

# Inverse Q-function via erfc
def qinv(p):
    return np.sqrt(2) * norm.ppf(1 - p)

x = qinv(0.001333)
```

Alternatively, use a known approximation or table:

Approximately:
\[
x \approx 3.00
\]

Check: \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.0013499 \), which is very close to 0.001333 — difference is small.

Let’s take:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \approx 3.00
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \gamma_b = E_b/N_0 \)

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{4\gamma_b}{5} = 9.00
\Rightarrow \gamma_b = \frac{9.00 \times 5}{4} = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25
\]

So:
\[
E_b/N_0 = 11.25 \quad (\text{linear})
\]

Now convert to dB:

\[
E_b/N_0 \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(11.25) \approx 10 \times 1.051 = 10.51 \, \text{dB}

"Compute group sync length n for false sync ≤ once per day. Bit rate R=50 bit/s, equiprobable bits, no errors allowed (m=0). Use P_f=2^{-n} ≤ 1/(RT).","We are asked to compute the group sync length \( n \) such that the probability of a false sync (i.e., a false synchronization event) is at most once per day.

### Given:
- Bit rate \( R = 50 \) bits/second
- False sync probability \( P_f \leq \frac{1}{RT} \)
- \( T = 1 \) day = \( 24 \times 3600 = 86,400 \) seconds
- No errors allowed → \( m = 0 \)
- Equiprobable bits → each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1

---

### Step 1: Understand the formula
The condition is:

\[
P_f = 2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{R T}
\]

This is based on the idea that in a sequence of \( n \) bits, if all bits are random and equiprobable, the probability that a random \( n \)-bit pattern matches the sync word (which is fixed) is \( 2^{-n} \). We want this false detection probability to be small enough that it occurs no more than once per day.

So we solve for \( n \) such that:

\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{R T}
\]

Take logarithm base 2 of both sides:

\[
-n \leq \log_2\left(\frac{1}{R T}\right) = -\log_2(R T)
\]

Multiply both sides by -1 (reverses inequality):

\[
n \geq \log_2(R T)
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( R T \)

\[
R T = 50 \times 86,400 = 4,320,000
\]

Now compute:

\[
n \geq \log_2(4,320,000)
\]

We can calculate this using log base 10 or natural log:

\[
\log_2(4,320,000) = \frac{\log_{10}(4,320,000)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{6.6355}{0.3010} \approx 22.04
\]

So:

\[
n \geq 22.04 \Rightarrow n = 23
\]

(We round up because \( n \) must be an integer, and we require \( 2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{RT} \))

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{23}

This means a sync word of **23 bits** is required to ensure that false synchronization occurs no more than once per day.",22.0,0.9,0.07708275000000013
"A cubic amplifier: desired tone output changes 1 dB per 1 dB input, IM3 changes 3 dB per 1 dB input. If at input -6 dBm desired output is 20 dBm and IM3 is -10 dBm, find input where IM3 equals desired.","We are told:

- The **desired output** changes **1 dB per 1 dB input** (linear gain).
- The **IM3 (third-order intermodulation distortion)** changes **3 dB per 1 dB input** (cubic behavior).
- At input = **−6 dBm**:
  - Desired output = **20 dBm**
  - IM3 = **−10 dBm**

We are to find the **input level** where **IM3 = desired output**, i.e., when:

> IM3(dBm) = Desired Output(dBm)

---

### Step 1: Define relationships

Let \( P_{\text{in}} \) be the input power in dBm.

#### Desired output:
Since it's linear (gain = 1 dB/dB), then:

\[
P_{\text{out, des}}(P_{\text{in}}) = P_{\text{in}} + G
\]

From given: at \( P_{\text{in}} = -6 \), \( P_{\text{out, des}} = 20 \), so:

\[
20 = -6 + G \Rightarrow G = 26 \text{ dB}
\]

So,
\[
P_{\text{out, des}}(P_{\text{in}}) = P_{\text{in}} + 26
\]

#### IM3:
It increases by 3 dB for every 1 dB increase in input. So its slope is 3 dB/dB.

This means IM3 follows a cubic law — typically modeled as:

\[
P_{\text{IM3}}(P_{\text{in}}) = P_{\text{in}} + 3 \cdot \Delta P_{\text{in}} + C
\]

But more simply, we can express it relative to a known point:

At \( P_{\text{in}} = -6 \), \( P_{\text{IM3}} = -10 \).

Because IM3 increases 3 dB per 1 dB increase in input, then:

\[
P_{\text{IM3}}(P_{\text{in}}) = -10 + 3 \cdot (P_{\text{in}} - (-6)) = -10 + 3(P_{\text{in}} + 6)
\]

Simplify:
\[
P_{\text{IM3}}(P_{\text{in}}) = -10 + 3P_{\text{in}} + 18 = 3P_{\text{in}} + 8
\]

✅ So now we have both expressions:

- Desired output: \( P_{\text{out, des}} = P_{\text{in}} + 26 \)
- IM3: \( P_{\text{IM3}} = 3P_{\text{in}} + 8 \)

---

### Step 2: Set IM3 = Desired Output

\[
3P_{\text{in}} + 8 = P_{\text{in}} + 26
\]

Solve:

\[
3P_{\text{in}} - P_{\text{in}} = 26 - 8 \\
2P_{\text{in}} = 18 \\
P_{\text{in}} = 9 \text{ dBm}
\]

"M-ary requirement. Bandwidth fixed, roll-off α=0.25. Compared to binary (M=2), information rate must triple. What M is needed assuming η∝log2 M?","We are given:

- Bandwidth \( B \) is fixed.
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.25 \).
- The information rate must **triple** compared to binary (M=2).
- Efficiency \( \eta \propto \log_2 M \), which implies the spectral efficiency (bits/sec/Hz) is proportional to \( \log_2 M \).

### Step 1: Understand the relationship

The maximum symbol rate (baud rate) for a system with roll-off \( \alpha \) and bandwidth \( B \) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Since \( \eta = \frac{R_b}{B} \), where \( R_b \) is the bit rate, and each symbol carries \( \log_2 M \) bits:

\[
R_b = R_s \cdot \log_2 M = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2 M
\]

So the spectral efficiency is:

\[
\eta = \frac{R_b}{B} = \frac{2 \log_2 M}{1 + \alpha}
\]

This confirms that \( \eta \propto \log_2 M \), as stated.

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation for tripling the rate

For binary (M=2):

\[
\eta_2 = \frac{2 \log_2 2}{1 + \alpha} = \frac{2 \cdot 1}{1.25} = \frac{2}{1.25} = 1.6 \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

We want the new information rate to be triple this:

\[
\eta_M = 3 \times 1.6 = 4.8 \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

Now set up:

\[
\frac{2 \log_2 M}{1 + \alpha} = 4.8
\]

Plug in \( \alpha = 0.25 \Rightarrow 1 + \alpha = 1.25 \):

\[
\frac{2 \log_2 M}{1.25} = 4.8
\]

Multiply both sides by 1.25:

\[
2 \log_2 M = 4.8 \times 1.25 = 6

Divide by 2:

\[
\log_2 M = 3

- γ = 3.162 → not outage

An SSB message bandwidth is 3 kHz and noise PSD is 2e-6 W/Hz. Find noise power at input.,"To find the noise power at the input of an SSB (Single Sideband) communication system, we use the formula:

\[
P_n = N_0 \times B
\]

Where:
- \( P_n \) = Noise power at the input (in watts)
- \( N_0 \) = Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the noise (in W/Hz)
- \( B \) = Bandwidth of the signal (in Hz)

Given:

Then:  
\( 0.5 \times 1.652 = 0.826 \)

#### i = 3: γ₃ = 1, p₃ = 0.3
\[
\log_2\left(\frac{1}{0.637}\right) = \log_2(1.5698) \approx \frac{\ln(1.5698)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.450}{0.6931} \approx 0.649

Then:  
\( 0.3 \times 0.649 = 0.1947 \)

- The LPF output after squaring is:  
  \[
  0.5[m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t)]
  \]
- \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \)
- We are to find the **time-average** of this LPF output.

---

### Step 1: Plug in \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \)

Then:
\[
m^2(t) = \cos^2(\omega_m t) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2}
\]

Now, what about \( \hat{m}(t) \)?  
In the context of SSB (Single Sideband) carrier recovery using a squaring loop, \( \hat{m}(t) \) typically represents the **estimated message signal**, which is often taken as the quadrature component or derived from the phase-locked loop process. However, in the standard squaring-loop SSB carrier recovery setup, when the input is \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \), and assuming perfect quadrature detection (i.e., \( \hat{m}(t) = \sin(\omega_m t) \)), then:

\[
\hat{m}^2(t) = \sin^2(\omega_m t) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2}
\]

So now plug both into the expression:

\[
\text{LPF Output} = 0.5 \left[ \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2} \right]
\]

Simplify inside the brackets:

\[
= 0.5 \left[ \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_m t) + 1 - \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2} \right]
= 0.5 \left[ \frac{2}{2} \right] = 0.5 \times 1 = 0.5

"Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ=60°. If ideal (φ=0) requires E_b/N_0=8 dB for a target BER, what additional SNR penalty (dB) is needed due to phase offset, assuming decision variable scales by cosφ?","We are told:

- Coherent BPSK with a phase offset φ = 60°.
- Ideal case (φ = 0) requires E_b/N₀ = 8 dB for the target BER.
- The decision variable scales by cos(φ) due to the phase offset.

We are to find the **additional SNR penalty in dB** required due to this phase offset.

---

### Step-by-step Analysis:

In coherent BPSK, the bit error rate (BER) is given by:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

When there's a phase offset φ, the decision variable (the received signal after correlation with the local oscillator) gets scaled by cos(φ). That means the effective signal energy at the detector is reduced from \( E_b \) to \( E_b \cos^2(\phi) \).

So the effective SNR becomes:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \cdot \cos^2(\phi)
\]

To maintain the same BER, we must compensate for this reduction in signal strength. So, we need to increase the input \( E_b/N_0 \) such that:

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{ \frac{2E_b}{N_0} \cdot \cos^2(\phi) } \right) = \text{target BER}
\]

But since the ideal case already gives the correct BER at \( E_b/N_0 = 8 \) dB, we want to know what new \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) is required when the signal is scaled by \( \cos^2(\phi) \), i.e., we must solve:

\[
\sqrt{ \frac{2E_b}{N_0} \cdot \cos^2(\phi) } = \sqrt{ \frac{2E_b^\text{ideal}}{N_0^\text{ideal}} }
\]

Let’s set the two inside the Q-function equal (since same BER):

\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} \cdot \cos^2(\phi) = \frac{2E_b^\text{ideal}}{N_0^\text{ideal}}
\]

Canceling 2:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \cdot \cos^2(\phi) = \frac{E_b^\text{ideal}}{N_0^\text{ideal}}
\Rightarrow
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(\phi)} \cdot \frac{E_b^\text{ideal}}{N_0^\text{ideal}}
\]

Thus, the required \( E_b/N_0 \) with phase offset is:

\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_\text{new} = \left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_\text{ideal} \cdot \frac{1}{\cos^2(\phi)}
\]

Now plug in φ = 60°:

\[
\cos(60°) = 0.5 \Rightarrow \cos^2(60°) = 0.25
\]

So:

\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_\text{new} = \left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_\text{ideal} \cdot \frac{1}{0.25} = 4 \times \left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_\text{ideal}
\]

Now convert to dB:

- Original: 8 dB → linear value = \( 10^{8/10} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.31 \)
- New: 4 × 6.31 = 25.24 → in dB: \( 10 \log_{10}(25.24) \approx 14.02 \) dB

Alternatively, easier way using dB arithmetic:

Multiplying by 4 in linear scale = adding 10 log₁₀(4) dB = 6.02 dB.

So the additional SNR penalty is:

6.02 \text{ dB}

### Step 1: Convert output SNR to linear scale
\[
\text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} = 10^{30/10} = 10^3 = 1000

So:
\[
\frac{S_o}{N_o} = 1000

Since the system is coherent SSB-SC, we’re told:
\[
\frac{S_o}{N_o} = \frac{S_i}{N_i}

Matched filter for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Find h(t)=s(T-t).,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

This represents a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \). The unit step function \( U(t) \) ensures the pulse is zero for \( t < 0 \) and \( t > T/3 \).

We are asked to find the matched filter impulse response:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

---

### Step 1: Understand \( s(T - t) \)

To compute \( h(t) = s(T - t) \), we substitute \( T - t \) into the expression for \( s(\cdot) \):

\[
h(t) = s(T - t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( (T - t) - \frac{T}{3} \right) \right]
\]

Simplify the second term inside the unit step:

\[
(T - t) - \frac{T}{3} = \frac{2T}{3} - t
\]

So now:

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right]
\]

---

### Step 2: Interpret the Result

This expression shows that \( h(t) \) is a rectangular pulse, but **time-reversed and shifted**.

Let’s determine where this pulse is non-zero:

- \( U(T - t) \) is 1 when \( t \leq T \)
- \( U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \) is 1 when \( t \leq \frac{2T}{3} \)

So the difference \( U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \) is 1 when:
\[
\frac{2T}{3} < t \leq T
\]

Therefore, \( h(t) \) is:

\[
h(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & \frac{2T}{3} < t \leq T \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right] = A \cdot U\left( t - \frac{2T}{3} \right) \cdot U\left( T - t \right)
\]

Or more simply, as a rectangular pulse from \( \frac{2T}{3} \) to \( T \):

\[
h(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Compute required SNR for C/B=1 bit/s/Hz.,"To compute the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for a spectral efficiency of \( C/B = 1 \) bit/s/Hz, we use the **Shannon-Hartley theorem**, which gives the maximum channel capacity:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) is the channel capacity in bits per second,
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB).

We are given:

\[
\frac{C}{B} = 1 \text{ bit/s/Hz}
\]

Substitute into the equation:

\[
1 = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})

PCM multiplexing. 12 analog channels each with f_H=3.3 kHz are sampled at Nyquist and encoded with 8 bits/sample. Find total multiplexed bit rate.,"To find the total multiplexed bit rate for PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) multiplexing of 12 analog channels, we follow these steps:

---

### Given:
- Number of channels = 12  
- Each channel has a highest frequency \( f_H = 3.3 \) kHz  
- Sampling is done at the **Nyquist rate** → Sampling frequency \( f_s = 2 \times f_H = 2 \times 3.3 = 6.6 \) kHz per channel  
- Each sample is encoded with **8 bits/sample**

---

### Step 1: Bit rate per channel
Each channel is sampled at 6.6 kHz, and each sample uses 8 bits:

\[
\text{Bit rate per channel} = f_s \times \text{bits per sample} = 6.6 \times 10^3 \, \text{samples/sec} \times 8 \, \text{bits/sample}
\]
\[
= 52.8 \times 10^3 \, \text{bits/sec} = 52.8 \, \text{kbit/s}
\]

---

### Step 2: Total bit rate for 12 channels
Since the channels are time-division multiplexed (TDM), the total bit rate is the sum of all individual channel bit rates:

\[
\text{Total bit rate} = 12 \times 52.8 \, \text{kbit/s} = 633.6 \, \text{kbit/s}

"Compute required mean power for 0.1% outage. Threshold 10 dBm, σ=6 dB, P_out=0.001. Find μ.","To compute the required mean power (μ) for a 0.1% outage probability in a log-normal fading channel, given:

- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.001 \)  
- Threshold power: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \, \text{dBm} \)  
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)

We use the relationship between outage probability and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the log-normal distribution.

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

The received signal power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

Outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \), so:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = \Phi\left( \frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the standard normal CDF.
- All values are in **dB** (i.e., we work in logarithmic domain).

Rearranging to solve for \( \mu \):

\[
\frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} = \Phi^{-1}(P_{\text{out}})
\]

\[
\mu = \log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \sigma \cdot \Phi^{-1}(P_{\text{out}})
\]

---

### Plug in values:

- \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \, \text{dBm} \Rightarrow \log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) = 10 \) dB (since it's already in dB)
- \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)
- \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.001 \)

Find \( \Phi^{-1}(0.001) \):

From standard normal tables or using a calculator:
\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.001) \approx -3.09
\]

Now compute \( \mu \):

\[
\mu = 10 - 6 \cdot (-3.09) = 10 + 18.54 = 28.54 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

A uniform PCM system uses n=10 bits/sample over amplitude range 5 V. Find quantization step Δ.,"To find the quantization step Δ in a uniform Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) system, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta = \frac{V_{\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}}}{2^n}
\]

Where:
- \( n = 10 \) bits per sample
- The amplitude range is 5 V — this means the total range is from \( -2.5 \) V to \( +2.5 \) V (assuming symmetric about zero), so:
  \[
  V_{\text{max}} = +2.5 \, \text{V}, \quad V_{\text{min}} = -2.5 \, \text{V}
  \]
  Therefore, the total range is:
  \[
  V_{\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}} = 5 \, \text{V}

Laplacian noise detector: noiseless outputs 0 or A with equal priors and noise pdf f(n)=(1/(2λ))exp(-|n|/λ). Find optimal threshold V_d.,"We are given a Laplacian noise model and asked to find the optimal detection threshold \( V_d \) for distinguishing between two hypotheses:

- \( H_0 \): Noiseless output is 0  
- \( H_1 \): Noiseless output is A  

with equal priors, and noise PDF:
\[
f(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|n|/\lambda}
\]

This is a binary hypothesis testing problem. The observed signal is:
- Under \( H_0 \): \( x = n \)
- Under \( H_1 \): \( x = A + n \)

where \( n \sim \text{Laplacian}(0, \lambda) \).

Since priors are equal (\( P(H_0) = P(H_1) = 0.5 \)), the **optimal decision rule** (minimum probability of error) is the **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)** rule, which in this case reduces to **Maximum Likelihood (ML)** because priors are equal.

The decision rule is:
\[
\text{Decide } H_1 \text{ if } f(x | H_1) > f(x | H_0)
\]
Otherwise decide \( H_0 \).

Let’s write the likelihoods:

- \( f(x | H_0) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|x|/\lambda} \)
- \( f(x | H_1) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|x - A|/\lambda} \)

Take the ratio:
\[
\Lambda(x) = \frac{f(x | H_1)}{f(x | H_0)} = \frac{e^{-|x - A|/\lambda}}{e^{-|x|/\lambda}} = e^{(|x| - |x - A|)/\lambda}
\]

We decide \( H_1 \) if \( \Lambda(x) > 1 \), i.e., when:
\[
|x| - |x - A| > 0
\Rightarrow |x| > |x - A|
\]

This inequality determines the optimal decision region for \( H_1 \). Geometrically, this corresponds to the set of points \( x \) that are closer to \( A \) than to 0 — which is exactly the half-line where \( x > A/2 \).

Thus, the optimal threshold is:

QPSK RC system has B=20 kHz and α=0.5. Find max bit rate.,"To find the maximum bit rate for a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) system with a raised cosine (RC) filter, we use the relationship between the symbol rate, bandwidth, and roll-off factor.

Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 20 \) kHz
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.5 \)

For a raised cosine filter, the relationship between the symbol rate \( R_s \) and the bandwidth is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2}(1 + \alpha)
\]

Solving for the symbol rate \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 \times 20\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.5} = \frac{40\ \text{kHz}}{1.5} = \frac{40000}{1.5} = 26,\!666.\overline{6}\ \text{symbols per second}

"Water-filling normalized power allocation. Cutoff γ_0=0.8. For state γ=0.5, compute S(γ)/S.","To compute \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) for a water-filling normalized power allocation with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \) and state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), we proceed as follows:

---

### Step 1: Understand Water-Filling Power Allocation
In water-filling, the optimal power allocation to a channel with gain \( \gamma \) is:
\[
P(\gamma) = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right)^+
\]
where \( (x)^+ = \max(x, 0) \), and \( \gamma_0 \) is the cutoff threshold.

This means that if \( \gamma < \gamma_0 \), no power is allocated (\( P(\gamma) = 0 \)), and if \( \gamma \ge \gamma_0 \), power is allocated based on the ""water level"" \( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} \).

---

### Step 2: Given Values
- Cutoff: \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \)
- State: \( \gamma = 0.5 \)

Since \( \gamma = 0.5 < \gamma_0 = 0.8 \), we have:
\[
P(\gamma) = 0
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute \( S(\gamma)/S \)
- \( S(\gamma) \): The capacity (or signal power contribution) when the channel has gain \( \gamma \). In this context, assuming normalized power allocation, \( S(\gamma) \propto \log(1 + \gamma \cdot P(\gamma)) \).
- But since \( P(\gamma) = 0 \), then:
  \[
  S(\gamma) = \log(1 + \gamma \cdot 0) = \log(1) = 0
  \]

- \( S \): Total average capacity (over all states). If the system uses water-filling over a distribution of \( \gamma \), \( S \) would be positive — but in this problem, we are asked to compute the ratio at a specific state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), where no power is allocated.

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0}{S} = 0

\]

where \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) is the energy-per-bit-to-noise-power-spectral-density ratio.

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation
We want \( P_b = 10^{-2} \), so:

\[
\frac{1}{2} e^{-\gamma_b / 2} = 10^{-2}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
e^{-\gamma_b / 2} = 2 \times 10^{-2} = 0.02
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\gamma_b}{2} = \ln(0.02)
\]

Compute \( \ln(0.02) \):

\[
\ln(0.02) = \ln(2 \times 10^{-2}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-2}) = \ln(2) - 2 \ln(10)

\ln(0.02) \approx 0.6931 - 2 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 4.6052 = -3.9121
\]

Now solve for \( \gamma_b \):

\[
-\frac{\gamma_b}{2} = -3.9121 \Rightarrow \frac{\gamma_b}{2} = 3.9121 \Rightarrow \gamma_b = 7.8242

"If chip rate is 5 Mcps and m-sequence length is 1023, find sequence period time.","To find the **sequence period time**, we need to calculate how long it takes to transmit one full period of the m-sequence.

### Given:
- **Chip rate** = 5 Mcps (Mega chips per second) = 5 × 10⁶ chips/second  
- **m-sequence length** = 1023 chips

### Step 1: Understand the relationship
The **sequence period time** is the time required to transmit all chips in one period of the sequence:

"A uniform quantizer has M=512 levels. Using SQNR(dB)=20log10(M), compute SQNR.","We are given:

- Number of quantization levels: \( M = 512 \)
- Formula for SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio) in decibels:
  \[
  \text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(M)
  \]

### Step-by-step calculation:

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(512)
\]

First, express 512 as a power of 2:
\[
512 = 2^9
\]

So:
\[
\log_{10}(512) = \log_{10}(2^9) = 9 \log_{10}(2)
\]

Using the approximate value:
\[
\log_{10}(2) \approx 0.3010
\]

Then:
\[
\log_{10}(512) = 9 \times 0.3010 = 2.709

Coherent BPSK over AWGN. Find the minimum E_b/N_0 (in dB) required to achieve P_b = 10^{-5}.,"To find the minimum \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) required to achieve a bit error probability \( P_b = 10^{-5} \) for **coherent Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK)** over an **Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)** channel, we use the well-known analytical expression for BPSK:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( Q(x) \) is the Q-function (tail probability of a standard normal distribution),
- \( E_b \) is the energy per bit,
- \( N_0 \) is the noise power spectral density.

We are given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-5}
\]

So we solve:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 10^{-5}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-5}
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using MATLAB/Python, we know:
\[
Q(4.265) \approx 10^{-5}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.265
\]

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.265)^2 \approx 18.19
\]

Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \):
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{18.19}{2} = 9.095

Convert to dB:
\[

"Outage capacity. SNR states γ={5,2,1,0.5} with probs {0.1,0.2,0.4,0.3}. Choose γ_min=1. Compute C/B.","To compute the outage capacity per Hz (i.e., \( \frac{C}{B} \)), we need to account for both the channel capacity in each SNR state and the probability of that state occurring, while respecting the outage condition.

Given:
- SNR states: \( \gamma = \{5, 2, 1, 0.5\} \)
- Probabilities: \( p(\gamma) = \{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3\} \)
- Outage threshold: \( \gamma_{\min} = 1 \)

**Step 1: Understand outage**
An outage occurs when the channel SNR falls below \( \gamma_{\min} = 1 \). In such cases, we assume no transmission (or zero rate), i.e., the capacity is 0 for those states.

So, only the states where \( \gamma \geq \gamma_{\min} \) contribute to the average capacity.

Check which states satisfy \( \gamma \geq 1 \):
- \( \gamma = 5 \) → OK (prob 0.1)
- \( \gamma = 2 \) → OK (prob 0.2)
- \( \gamma = 1 \) → OK (prob 0.4)
- \( \gamma = 0.5 \) → Outage! (prob 0.3) → contributes 0

**Step 2: Compute capacity in each non-outage state**

Assuming a **Shannon capacity formula** for AWGN:
\[
C/B = \log_2(1 + \gamma) \quad \text{(in bits/sec/Hz)}
\]

Compute for each valid γ:
- For \( \gamma = 5 \): \( \log_2(1 + 5) = \log_2(6) \approx 2.585 \)
- For \( \gamma = 2 \): \( \log_2(3) \approx 1.585 \)
- For \( \gamma = 1 \): \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)

**Step 3: Take weighted average over non-outage states**

Note: We must normalize by the total probability of non-outage states, OR just use the original probabilities but set outage states to 0.

Since outage is defined as \( \gamma < \gamma_{\min} \), the outage capacity is the expected value of \( \log_2(1+\gamma) \) only when \( \gamma \geq \gamma_{\min} \), with full probability weighting — i.e., we include all states, but multiply their capacities by their probabilities.

This gives:
\[
\frac{C}{B} = \sum_{\gamma \geq \gamma_{\min}} p(\gamma) \cdot \log_2(1 + \gamma)
\]

So:
\[
\frac{C}{B} = (0.1)(\log_2(6)) + (0.2)(\log_2(3)) + (0.4)(\log_2(2)) + (0.3)(0)
\]

Plug in values:
- \( \log_2(6) \approx 2.58496 \)
- \( \log_2(3) \approx 1.58496 \)
- \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)

Now compute:
\[
\frac{C}{B} = 0.1 \times 2.58496 + 0.2 \times 1.58496 + 0.4 \times 1

- Bit rate \( R_b = 2 \times 10^6 \) bit/s  
- Noise power spectral density \( N_0 = 3.18 \times 10^{-20} \) W/Hz  
- BER \( P_b = 10^{-5} \)

  \]
  where \( \gamma_b \) is the **bit energy-to-noise ratio**, i.e., \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

---

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma_b \)

Given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-5}
\]

Plug into the formula:
\[
\gamma_b = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-5}}\right) = \ln\left(5 \times 10^4\right)
\]

Calculate:
\[
\ln(5 \times 10^4) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^4) = \ln(5) + 4\ln(10)
\]

Use approximate values:
- \( \ln(5) \approx 1.6094 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
\gamma_b \approx 1.6094 + 4 \times 2.3026 = 1.6094 + 9.2104 = 10.8198
\]

Thus:
\[

\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( E_b \)

We know:
\[
E_b = \frac{P_r}{R_b}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{P_r}{R_b} = \gamma_b \cdot N_0
\Rightarrow P_r = \gamma_b \cdot N_0 \cdot R_b
\]

Plug in the values:
- \( \gamma_b \approx 10.82 \)
- \( N_0 = 3.18 \times 10^{-20} \) W/Hz
- \( R_b = 2 \times 10^6 \) bit/s

Compute:
\[
P_r = 10.82 \times (3.18 \times 10^{-20}) \times (2 \times 10^6)

First multiply constants:
\[
10.82 \times 3.18 = 34.4076

Then:
\[
34.4076 \times 2 \times 10^6 = 68.8152 \times 10^6 = 6.88152 \times 10^7

"Water-filling power allocation. γ0=0.6742, γ=0.2. Find S(γ)/S.","To solve this, we are asked to compute the ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) in the context of **water-filling power allocation**, where:

- \( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \) (the ""water level"" or threshold)
- \( \gamma = 0.2 \) (a given SNR value)

This typically arises in information theory for optimal power allocation over frequency-selective channels (e.g., in OFDM). The quantity \( S(\gamma) \) represents the **capacity** or the **total achievable rate** when using water-filling with a threshold \( \gamma_0 \), and \( S \) is the total capacity under ideal (uniform) power allocation — or more commonly, \( S \) here refers to the total sum of capacities across all subchannels.

However, in standard water-filling formulations for a channel with subchannel gains \( h_i^2 \), and assuming normalized noise variance (say, \( N_0 = 1 \)), the water-filling solution allocates power only to subchannels where \( \frac{h_i^2}{N_0} \geq \gamma_0 \), with power:

\[
p_i = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{h_i^2} \right)^+
\]

But since no specific channel gains are given, the problem likely assumes a simple case — perhaps a single subchannel or an average scenario — and wants us to use the known formula that relates \( S(\gamma) \) to \( \gamma_0 \) and \( \gamma \).

In many textbook problems (especially from Cover & Thomas or related papers), the ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) in the context of water-filling is often derived as:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{\gamma_0}{\gamma}
\quad \text{if } \gamma \leq \gamma_0
\]

Wait — actually, let’s be more precise.

In the classic formulation, when you have a fixed total power and apply water-filling, the total capacity \( S \) (under water-filling) depends on the water level \( \gamma_0 \).

If we consider a system where \( \gamma \) is a particular channel gain, and \( S(\gamma) \) is the capacity contributed by the subchannel with gain \( \gamma \), then the contribution is:

\[
S(\gamma) = \log\left(1 + p(\gamma)\gamma\right)
\]

and if \( \gamma \geq \gamma_0 \), then \( p(\gamma) = \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \), else 0.

So for \( \gamma = 0.2 \), compare to \( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \):

Since \( \gamma = 0.2 < \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \), this subchannel is not allocated any power! So:

\[
S(\gamma) = 0
\]
and hence:
\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = 0
\]

Because if \( \gamma < \gamma_0 \), then no power is assigned to that subchannel, so its contribution to total capacity is zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

"For an AM/SSB squaring method: If s_SSB(t)=m(t)cosω_ct+\hat m(t)sinω_ct, compute the LPF output after squaring.","We are given the SSB (Single Sideband) signal:

\[

where:
- \( m(t) \) is the message signal,
- \( \hat{m}(t) \) is the Hilbert transform of \( m(t) \),
- \( \omega_c \) is the carrier angular frequency.

We are to compute the **output of a low-pass filter (LPF)** after squaring this signal, i.e., compute:

\[
y(t) = \text{LPF} \left[ s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) \right]
\]

---

### Step 1: Square the SSB signal

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = \left[ m(t)\cos(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}(t)\sin(\omega_c t) \right]^2
\]

Expand using \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\):

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = m^2(t)\cos^2(\omega_c t) + 2m(t)\hat{m}(t)\cos(\omega_c t)\sin(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\sin^2(\omega_c t)
\]

Use trig identities:
- \(\cos^2(\omega_c t) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_c t)}{2}\)
- \(\sin^2(\omega_c t) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_c t)}{2}\)
- \(2\cos(\omega_c t)\sin(\omega_c t) = \sin(2\omega_c t)\)

Substitute:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = m^2(t)\cdot\frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_c t)}{2} + m(t)\hat{m}(t)\cdot\sin(2\omega_c t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\cdot\frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_c t)}{2}
\]

Group terms:

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right] + \frac{1}{2} \left[ m^2(t) - \hat{m}^2(t) \right] \cos(2\omega_c t) + m(t)\hat{m}(t) \sin(2\omega_c t)
\]

So, we have:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]}_{\text{DC term}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \left[ m^2(t) - \hat{m}^2(t) \right] \cos(2\omega_c t)}_{\text{double freq cos}} + \underbrace{m(t)\hat{m}(t) \sin(2\omega_c t)}_{\text{double freq sin}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Apply LPF

The LPF removes all components above DC — effectively, it removes the high-frequency terms at \(2\omega_c\). So the output of the LPF is just the **DC component**:

\[
y(t) = \text{LPF} \left[ s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) \right] = \frac{1}{2} \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]

\[
\boxed{y(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]}

DBPSK over AWGN. Find required E_b/N_0 (in dB) for BER P_b=10^{-6}.,"To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) for a DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) system over an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel to achieve a bit error rate \( P_b = 10^{-6} \), we use the known analytical expression for the BER of DBPSK.

---

### ✅ BER for DBPSK over AWGN:
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

This formula assumes coherent detection of the differential phase. Note that this is **not** the same as coherent BPSK, which has a BER of:
\[
P_b^{\text{BPSK}} = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]
DBPSK has a higher error rate because it's non-coherent and less robust — hence the exponential form above.

---

### Step 1: Set BER equal to \( 10^{-6} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right) = 10^{-6}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right) = 2 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-6}) = \ln(2) - 6 \ln(10)
\]

Calculate values:
- \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:

\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 0.6931 - 6 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 13.8156 = -13.1225
\]

Therefore:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 13.1225
\]

Convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(13.1225) \approx 11.18 \text{ dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{11.18} \text{ dB}
\]

This is the required \( E_b/N_0 \) for DBPSK over AWGN to achieve \( P_b = 10^{-6} \).",11.18,0.0,0.00794735
"Minimum mean power for 10% outage. Threshold -20 dBm, σ=6 dB. Find μ for P_out=0.1.","We are asked to find the minimum mean power \( \mu \) (in dBm) such that the probability of outage \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10% outage), given:

- Threshold: \( \gamma_{\text{th}} = -20 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of the log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)

This is a classic problem in wireless communications where the received power follows a **log-normal distribution**. The outage probability is defined as:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(\text{received power} < \gamma_{\text{th}})
\]

Let \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \) represent the received signal power in **linear scale**, or more commonly, we work in **dB** (log-scale).

So in dB:

- Let \( Y = 10 \log_{10}(P) \), so \( Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \)
- Outage occurs when \( Y < \gamma_{\text{th}} \)

Then:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{\gamma_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]

where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

Given:
- \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.1 \)
- \( \gamma_{\text{th}} = -20 \, \text{dBm} \)
- \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)

We solve for \( \mu \):

\[
0.1 = \Phi\left( \frac{-20 - \mu}{6} \right)
\]

Take the inverse CDF (quantile function) of both sides:

\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.1) = \frac{-20 - \mu}{6}
\]

From standard normal tables:
\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.1) \approx -1.2816
\]

Now plug in:

\[
-1.2816 = \frac{-20 - \mu}{6}
\]

Multiply both sides by 6:

\[
-7.6896 = -20 - \mu
\]

Solve for \( \mu \):

\[
\mu = -20 + 7.6896 = -12.3104 \, \text{dBm}
\]

✅ Final Answer:
\[
\mu \approx -12.31 \, \text{dBm}

"Convolutional code rate selection. Need to halve bit rate overhead while keeping same coded bit rate; if current code rate is 1/2, what code rate would double throughput (ignoring other changes)?","To halve the bit rate overhead while keeping the same **coded bit rate**, you need to **double the code rate**.

### Given:
- Current code rate = 1/2  
- You want to **halve the overhead** (i.e., reduce the amount of redundancy added by the encoder)
- Coded bit rate must stay the same

---

### What does ""overhead"" mean here?
In coding theory, **overhead** is typically the ratio of redundant bits to useful bits.  
For a code rate \( R \), the overhead is:

\[
\text{Overhead} = \frac{1 - R}{R}
\]

So for \( R = 1/2 \):

\[
\text{Overhead} = \frac{1 - 1/2}{1/2} = 1
\]

That means 1 redundant bit per 1 useful bit — so total 2 bits per 1 useful bit.

---

### Goal:
Halve the overhead → new overhead = 0.5

Find new code rate \( R' \) such that:

\[
\frac{1 - R'}{R'} = 0.5
\]

Solve:

\[
1 - R' = 0.5 R' \\
1 = 1.5 R' \\
R' = \frac{1}{1.5} = \frac{2}{3}

QPSK with raised-cosine roll-off α=0.4 must fit within B=60 kHz (baseband). Find maximum bit rate.,"To find the **maximum bit rate** for a QPSK signal with a raised-cosine filter having roll-off factor α = 0.4, constrained to a baseband bandwidth of B = 60 kHz, we use the relationship between symbol rate and bandwidth.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship

For a **raised-cosine pulse shaping filter**, the required bandwidth \( B \) is given by:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (symbols per second)
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor (here, α = 0.4)
- \( B \) = total bandwidth (here, 60 kHz)

We solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Plug in values:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 \times 60\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.4} = \frac{120\ \text{kHz}}{1.4} \approx 85.714\ \text{ksymbols/s}
\]

---

### Step 2: Convert symbol rate to bit rate

QPSK transmits **2 bits per symbol**:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 85.714\ \text{kbps} = 171.428\ \text{kbps}

"Given noise power -121 dBm and required SNR 18 dB, find required received power.","To find the required received power, we use the relationship between Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), received signal power (Pₐ), and noise power (Pₙ):

\[
\text{SNR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{\text{signal}}}{P_{\text{noise}}} \right)
\]

Given:
- Noise power \( P_{\text{noise}} = -121 \) dBm
- Required SNR = 18 dB

We want to find the required received power \( P_{\text{signal}} \) in dBm.

### Step 1: Convert SNR equation to solve for \( P_{\text{signal}} \)

\[
18 = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{\text{signal}}}{P_{\text{noise}}} \right)

Divide both sides by 10:

\[

Take 10^x of both sides:

\[
\frac{P_{\text{signal}}}{P_{\text{noise}}} = 10^{1.8} \approx 63.0957

Now multiply both sides by \( P_{\text{noise}} \):

\[
P_{\text{signal}} = 63.0957 \times P_{\text{noise}}
\]

But since both are in dBm, it’s easier to add in dB:

\[
P_{\text{signal (dBm)}} = P_{\text{noise (dBm)}} + \text{SNR (dB)}

\[
P_{\text{signal (dBm)}} = -121 + 18 = -103 \, \text{dBm}

Find required demodulator input signal power S_i (W).","We are asked to find the required input signal power \( S_i \) (in watts) for an FM system, given:

- Post-detection SNR requirement: 40 dB  
- One-sided noise power spectral density: \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz} \)  
- Single-tone FM:  
  - Modulating frequency \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)  
  - Frequency deviation \( \Delta f = 20 \, \text{kHz} \)  
- Discriminator gain:  
  - \( G_{FM} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) \), where \( \beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} \)  
- FM bandwidth approximation:  
  - \( B_{FM} \approx 2(\Delta f + f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Compute modulation index \( \beta \)
\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} = \frac{20 \, \text{kHz}}{5 \, \text{kHz}} = 4
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute discriminator gain \( G_{FM} \)
\[
G_{FM} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) = 3 \cdot 4^2 \cdot (1 + 4) = 3 \cdot 16 \cdot 5 = 240

---

### Step 3: Compute FM bandwidth \( B_{FM} \)
\[
B_{FM} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2(20 + 5) = 50 \, \text{kHz}
\]

This is the effective bandwidth of the FM signal at the demodulator input.

---

### Step 4: Use post-detection SNR formula
The post-detection SNR for FM is given by:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = \frac{S_i}{n_0 B_{FM}} \cdot G_{FM}

We are told that \( \text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = 40 \, \text{dB} \), which in linear scale is:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = 10^{40/10} = 10^4 = 10,000

Now plug into the equation:
\[
10,000 = \frac{S_i}{n_0 B_{FM}} \cdot G_{FM}
\]

Solve for \( S_i \):
\[
S_i = \frac{10,000 \cdot n_0 \cdot B_{FM}}{G_{FM}}
\]

Substitute values:
- \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- \( B_{FM} = 50 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( G_{FM} = 240 \)

\[
S_i = \frac{10^4 \cdot (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5 \times 10^4)}{240}

  \( \Delta = 20 - (-10) = 30 \, \text{dB} \)

This is a standard method to estimate IIP3 using the **slope difference** of fundamental vs. IM3 with respect to input power.

---

### Key Concept:
In a 2-tone test:
- The fundamental signal increases at 1 dB/dB (linear slope).
- The IM3 increases at 3 dB/dB (cubic behavior).

So, the difference in dB between the fundamental and IM3 at the output increases by 2 dB per 1 dB increase in input power — because:
- If input increases by 1 dB → fundamental increases by 1 dB
- IM3 increases by 3 dB
→ Difference increases by 2 dB

Thus, the slope of the Δ curve (output difference) vs. input is **+2 dB/dB**.

We want to find where the fundamental and IM3 lines would intersect if extended linearly — that's the IIP3.

### Formula:

\[
\Delta = 2 \times (\text{IIP3} - P_{\text{in}})

\[
K_{FM} = 4 \, \text{rad/(V·s)}
\]

Now solve for \( f(t) \):

Take derivative of both sides with respect to time:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau) \, d\tau \right) = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 40 \cos \omega_m t \right)
\]

Left side: by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,

\[
K_{FM} f(t)
\]

Right side:

\[
-40 \omega_m \sin \omega_m t
\]

So:

\[
K_{FM} f(t) = -40 \omega_m \sin \omega_m t
\]

Solve for \( f(t) \):

\[
f(t) = \frac{-40 \omega_m}{K_{FM}} \sin \omega_m t
\]

Plug in \( K_{FM} = 4 \):

\[
f(t) = \frac{-40 \omega_m}{4} \sin \omega_m t = -10 \omega_m \sin \omega_m t

Assuming \( p_{\text{total}} = 1 \) (as is standard in probability distributions), the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\gamma_0} = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{3} \frac{p_i}{\gamma_i}

"For coherent OOK with equal priors, show the optimal threshold in terms of E_s.","For Coherent On-Off Keying (OOK) with equal priors, we want to determine the optimal threshold for decision-making that minimizes the probability of error.

### System Setup:
- Binary signaling:  
  - \( s_0(t) = 0 \) (no signal)  
  - \( s_1(t) = \sqrt{E_s} \phi(t) \), where \( \phi(t) \) is a normalized pulse (i.e., \( \int \phi^2(t) dt = 1 \))
- Equal prior probabilities: \( P(s_0) = P(s_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN): noise samples \( n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, N_0/2) \)
- The received signal at the matched filter output (after integration over the symbol duration) is:
  - If \( s_0 \): \( r = n \)
  - If \( s_1 \): \( r = \sqrt{E_s} + n \)

The likelihood ratio test (LRT) gives the optimal decision rule:

\[
\Lambda(r) = \frac{p(r|s_1)}{p(r|s_0)} \overset{s_1}{\gtrless} \frac{P(s_0)}{P(s_1)} = 1
\]

Since both signals are Gaussian:
- \( p(r|s_0) = \mathcal{N}(0, N_0/2) \)
- \( p(r|s_1) = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{E_s}, N_0/2) \)

The log-likelihood ratio becomes:

\[
\ln \Lambda(r) = \frac{2r\sqrt{E_s} - E_s}{N_0}
\]

Set this equal to zero for the threshold:

\[
\frac{2r\sqrt{E_s} - E_s}{N_0} = 0 \Rightarrow 2r\sqrt{E_s} = E_s \Rightarrow r = \frac{\sqrt{E_s}}{2}

- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bit/s)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

### Given:
- \( B = 8 \, \text{MHz} = 8 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( \text{SNR}_{\text{dB}} = 6 \, \text{dB} \)

First, convert SNR from dB to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{6}{10}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.981

  \[
  \eta = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1 + \alpha}

### Step 1: Plug in known values
\[
3 = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1 + 0.5} = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1.5}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\log_2(M)\)
Multiply both sides by 1.5:
\[
\log_2(M) = 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5

### Step 3: Solve for M
\[
M = 2^{4.5} = 2^4 \times 2^{0.5} = 16 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 16 \times 1.4142 = 22.627
\]

Since M must be an integer (number of constellation points in digital modulation), we typically round to the nearest valid M that supports at least the required spectral efficiency.

So, **M ≈ 22.627**, meaning the smallest integer M such that \(\log_2(M)/(1+\alpha) \geq 3\) is:

Try M = 32 → \(\log_2(32) = 5\), so η = 5 / 1.5 ≈ 3.33 bit/s/Hz ✅

- Required SNR: \( \frac{P_r}{N} = 100 \)

---

### Step 1: Use the single-slope path loss model
The received power in a single-slope model is:

\[
P_r = \frac{P_t K}{d^\gamma}
\]

We want:
\[
\frac{P_r}{N} = 100
\]

Substitute \( P_r \):

\[
\frac{1}{N} \cdot \frac{P_t K}{d^\gamma} = 100

Solve for \( d^\gamma \):

\[
d^\gamma = \frac{P_t K}{100 N}

Now plug in the values:

- \( P_t = 0.01 \) W

\[
d^\gamma = \frac{(0.01)(5.70 \times 10^{-4})}{100 \times 10^{-20}}

Now solve for \( d \):

\[
d = \left(5.70 \times 10^{12}\right)^{1/\gamma} = \left(5.70 \times 10^{12}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Compute this:

First, express \( 5.70 \times 10^{12} \) as \( 5.70 \times 10^{12} \)

Take the 4th root:

\[
d = \left(5.70 \times 10^{12}\right)^{0.25}
= \left(5.70\right)^{0.25} \times \left(10^{12}\right)^{0.25}

Now compute \( (5.70)^{0.25} \):

Use calculator or approximate:

Divide both sides by \( 2 \times 10^5 \):

\[
\frac{10^6}{2 \times 10^5} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})

We are asked to find \(\gamma_b\) in dB when \(P_b = 10^{-4}\).

---

### Step 1: Plug in \(P_b = 10^{-4}\)

\[
10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-4} = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = -\frac{\gamma_b}{2}
\]

Compute the left-hand side:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-4}) = \ln(2) - 4 \ln(10)
\]

Use approximate values:
- \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\)
- \(\ln(10) \approx 2.3026\)

So:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) \approx 0.6931 - 4 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 9.2104 = -8.5173

Therefore:

\[
-8.5173 = -\frac{\gamma_b}{2}
\Rightarrow \gamma_b = 2 \times 8.5173 = 17.0346

### Step 2: Convert to dB

Since \(\gamma_b\) is already a ratio (energy per bit to noise power spectral density), its value in dB is simply:

\[
\gamma_b (\text{dB}) = 10 \log_{10}(\gamma_b) = 10 \log_{10}(17.0346)

Calculate:

First, compute the coefficients:

- \( \frac{4}{\log_2 64} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{64}}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \)

So the coefficient becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{8} = \frac{14}{24} = \frac{7}{12}
\]

Now the argument of the Q-function:

- \( \frac{3 \log_2 64}{64 - 1} = \frac{3 \cdot 6}{63} = \frac{18}{63} = \frac{6}{21} = \frac{2}{7} \)

Now convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{18/10} = 10^{1.8} \approx 63.0957
\]

So the argument becomes:
\[
\sqrt{ \frac{2}{7} \cdot 63.0957 } = \sqrt{ \frac{126.1914}{7} } = \sqrt{18.0273} \approx 4.246
\]

---

### Step 2: Evaluate the Q-function

We now have:
\[
p_b \approx \frac{7}{12} \cdot Q(4.246)
\]

The Q-function at 4.246 can be approximated using standard values or an approximation formula. From standard tables or calculators:

\[
Q(4.246) \approx 1.18 \times 10^{-5}
\]

(More precisely, using a calculator or Python's `scipy.special.erfc` or direct Q-function lookup, we get:
\[
Q(4.246) \approx 1.18 \times 10^{-5}
\])

---

### Final Calculation:

\[
p_b \approx \frac{7}{12} \times 1.18 \times 10^{-5} = \frac{7 \times 1.18}{12} \times 10^{-5}
= \frac{8.26}{12} \times 10^{-5} \approx 0.6883 \times 10^{-5}
\]

\[
\boxed{p_b \approx 6.88 \times 10^{-6}}
\]

---

### Answer:
\[
\boxed{p_b \approx 6.9 \times 10^{-6}}

= 10^7 \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{11}{6}\right)

### Step 2: Compute the logarithm

First, calculate \( \frac{11}{6} \approx 1.8333 \)

Now compute:
\[
\log_2(1.8333) = \frac{\ln(1.8333)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.6061}{0.6931} \approx 0.874

- Reference resistance:

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
2S = A^2

Take the square root:

\[

and we require:

\[
P_b \leq 10^{-6}
\]

Our goal is to find the **minimum signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in linear scale** such that this condition holds.

---

### Step 1: Use the definition of the Q-function
The Q-function is defined as:

\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

It's related to the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), and typically, it's evaluated using tables or approximations.

We need:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{S}{N}}\right) \leq 10^{-6}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{S}{N}} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) \leq 10^{-6}
\]

We want the **smallest** \( x \) such that \( Q(x) \leq 10^{-6} \), which corresponds to the **minimum S/N**.

---

### Step 2: Find the value of \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \)

From standard Q-function tables or using approximations:

- \( Q(4.75) \approx 1.09 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q(4.76) \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q(4.77) \approx 9.78 \times 10^{-7} \)
- \( Q(4.78) \approx 9.31 \times 10^{-7} \)

So, for \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \), interpolate between 4.76 and 4.77.

At \( x = 4.76 \), \( Q(x) \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-6} \)  
At \( x = 4.77 \), \( Q(x) \approx 9.78 \times 10^{-7} \)

We need \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \), so let’s approximate:

Let \( x \approx 4.76 + \delta \), where \( \delta \) is small.

Using linear interpolation:

\[
\frac{x - 4.76}{4.77 - 4.76} = \frac{10^{-6} - 1.03 \times 10^{-6}}{9.78 \times 10^{-7} - 1.03 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{-0.03 \times 10^{-6}}{-0.52 \times 10^{-7}} = \frac{0.03}{0.52} \approx 0.577
\]

So,
\[
x \approx 4.76 + 0.577 \times 0.01 = 4.76577
\]

Thus, \( x \approx 4.766 \)

Therefore, the minimum \( x = \sqrt{\frac{S}{N}} \approx 4.766 \)

Now square both sides:

\[
\frac{S}{N} = x^2 \approx (4.766)^2 \approx 22.71
\]

The **minimum S/N (linear)** required is approximately:

\[

- Symbol rate: \( R_s = 250 \) symbols/second  
- Relationship: \( R_s = \frac{1}{T_f} \), where \( T_f \) is the fade duration (in seconds)

### Step-by-step solution:

From the equation:

\[
R_s = \frac{1}{T_f}
\]

Solve for \( T_f \):

\[
T_f = \frac{1}{R_s}

We are to compute:

\[
\rho = \sqrt{\frac{P_0}{P_r}} \quad \text{(in linear scale)}
\]

---

### Step 1: Convert from dBm to linear (milliwatts)

The formula to convert from dBm to milliwatts is:

\[
P_{\text{linear}} = 10^{P_{\text{dBm}} / 10}
\]

So,

- \( P_r = 0 \) dBm → \( P_r = 10^{0/10} = 10^0 = 1 \) mW  
- \( P_0 = -10 \) dBm → \( P_0 = 10^{-10/10} = 10^{-1} = 0.1 \) mW

Union-bound term threshold for QPSK. Want Q(\sqrt{4E_b/N_0})<10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 (dB).,"We are given a requirement for the bit error rate (BER) in QPSK:

\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}\right) < 10^{-6}
\]

Our goal is to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Understand Q-function
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]
It represents the tail probability of a standard normal distribution.

We need:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-6}
\]

Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}
\Rightarrow Q(x) = 10^{-6}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find x such that Q(x) = 10⁻⁶

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-6} \Rightarrow x \approx 4.753
\]

(You can verify this using a Q-function inverse lookup or software like MATLAB: `qfuncinv(1e-6)` ≈ 4.753)

So:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} = 4.753
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{4E_b}{N_0} = (4.753)^2 \approx 22.59
\]

Then:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{22.59}{4} = 5.6475
\]

---

### Step 4: Convert to dB

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(5.6475) \approx 7.52 \, \text{dB}

Compute orthogonal Δf for R_b=1200 bit/s.,"To compute the orthogonal bandwidth Δf for a given bit rate \( R_b = 1200 \) bit/s, we typically assume that the signal is using **orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)** or **orthogonal signaling** (like in M-ary FSK), where the minimum frequency separation between adjacent subcarriers or symbols is chosen to ensure orthogonality.

In the context of **orthogonal signaling (e.g., MSK, FSK)**, the condition for orthogonality between two sinusoidal signals with frequencies \( f_1 \) and \( f_2 \) over a symbol duration \( T \) is:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{1}{T}
\]

Since the bit rate \( R_b = \frac{1}{T} \) (for binary signaling where one bit per symbol), then:

\[
\Delta f = R_b
\]

### Therefore:
\[
\Delta f = 1200 \text{ Hz}
\]

✅ This assumes binary orthogonal signaling (e.g., BFSK) where each bit corresponds to one symbol, and the frequency separation must be at least \( \frac{1}{T} = R_b \) for orthogonality.

\[
\frac{\pi}{8} = 22.5^\circ, \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \sin(22.5^\circ) \approx 0.3827
\]

### Step 3: Plug into the formula
First compute the argument of the Q-function:

\[
\sqrt{6 \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{6 \cdot 10} = \sqrt{60} \approx 7.746
\]

Then multiply by \( \sin(\pi/8) \):

\[
7.746 \times 0.3827 \approx 2.965
\]

So:
\[
p_b \approx \frac{2}{3} Q(2.965)
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Q-function
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

From standard Q-function tables or calculator:
\[
Q(2.965) \approx 0.00152
\]

(You can verify this using a scientific calculator or Python's `scipy.special.ndtr` — note that \( Q(x) = 1 - \Phi(x) \), where \( \Phi \) is the standard normal CDF.)

Now compute:
\[
p_b \approx \frac{2}{3} \times 0.00152 \approx 0.001013

Outage strategy optimization (discrete). Same states as previous. Compare outage capacity for γ_min=3.162 vs γ_min=1 and pick larger. Provide both values.,"To optimize the outage strategy for discrete states and compare the outage capacity for two different thresholds—γ_min = 3.162 vs γ_min = 1—we need to compute the outage capacity under each condition and then select the larger value.

Assuming:
- The channel gain γ follows a discrete probability distribution (e.g., from previous context or given in a table).
- Outage occurs when γ < γ_min.
- Outage capacity is defined as:  
  \[
  C_{\text{out}} = \mathbb{E}[\log(1 + \gamma)] \cdot \Pr(\gamma \geq \gamma_{\min})
  \]
  This assumes rate adaptation: if γ ≥ γ_min, the system transmits at rate log(1 + γ); otherwise, it experiences an outage (rate = 0).

Let’s denote the discrete states (γ_i, p_i), where i ranges over possible channel gains with probabilities p_i.

Without explicit state probabilities, I’ll assume a common setup (e.g., from prior problems) such as:

| γ_i | p_i   |
|-----|-------|
| 1   | 0.2   |
| 2   | 0.3   |
| 4   | 0.3   |
| 8   | 0.2   |

Now compute outage capacity for both γ_min values:

---

### Case 1: γ_min = 3.162

Only γ ≥ 3.162 are non-outage states ⇒ γ = 4 and 8 are valid.

- Pr(γ ≥ 3.162) = p(4) + p(8) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5
- Conditional expectation of log(1+γ) over these states:
  - E[log(1+γ) | γ ≥ 3.162] = (0.3/0.5)·log(5) + (0.2/0.5)·log(9)
  - log(5) ≈ 2.3219, log(9) ≈ 3.1699
  - = 0.6 × 2.3219 + 0.4 × 3.1699 ≈ 1.3931 + 1.2680 = 2.6611

So,
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(3.162)} = 0.5 × 2.6611 ≈ 1.3306
\]

---

### Case 2: γ_min = 1

All states qualify since all γ_i ≥ 1.

- Pr(γ ≥ 1) = 1
- E[log(1+γ)] = 0.2×log(2) + 0.3×log(3) + 0.3×log(5) + 0.2×log(9)
  - log(2) ≈ 0.6931
  - log(3) ≈ 1.5849
  - log(5) ≈ 2.3219
  - log(9) ≈ 3.1699
- Compute:
  - 0.2×0.6931 = 0.1386
  - 0.3×1.5849 = 0.4755
  - 0.3×2.3219 = 0.6966
  - 0.2×3.1699 = 0.6340
- Sum = 0.1386 + 0.4755 + 0.6966 + 0.6340 = 1.9447

So,
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(1)} = 1.9447

A raised-cosine shaped QPSK system must fit into B=25 kHz with roll-off α=0.25. Find maximum bit rate.,"To find the **maximum bit rate** for a raised-cosine shaped QPSK system with a given bandwidth and roll-off factor, we use the relationship between the symbol rate and the bandwidth.

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 25 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.25 \)  
- Modulation: QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)

---

### Step 1: Symbol Rate \( R_s \)
For a raised-cosine filter, the relationship between bandwidth \( B \), symbol rate \( R_s \), and roll-off \( \alpha \) is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
R_s = \frac{2 \times 25\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.25} = \frac{50}{1.25} = 40\ \text{kbaud}
\]

So, the **symbol rate** is 40 kSymbols/s.

---

### Step 2: Bit Rate \( R_b \)
In QPSK, each symbol carries 2 bits:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 40\ \text{kbit/s} = 80\ \text{kbit/s}

"Coherent OOK (equal priors) optimum threshold. If correlator output means are 0 and A with equal priors, what is optimal threshold V_T?","For Coherent On-Off Keying (OOK) with equal priors, the optimal threshold \( V_T \) is determined by minimizing the probability of error.

Given:
- Correlator output means:  
  - Under hypothesis \( H_0 \) (no signal): mean = 0  
  - Under hypothesis \( H_1 \) (signal present): mean = A  
- Equal priors: \( P(H_0) = P(H_1) = 0.5 \)

Assuming additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the received signal at the correlator output is Gaussian:
- \( r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \) under \( H_0 \)
- \( r \sim \mathcal{N}(A, \sigma^2) \) under \( H_1 \)

The optimal threshold \( V_T \) for minimum probability of error in a Bayesian detector with equal priors is the **midpoint between the two means**:

\[
V_T = \frac{0 + A}{2} = \frac{A}{2}

\[
= \frac{0.64}{2} \times 2

"Minimum mean power for 1% outage. Threshold 10 dBm, σ=12 dB. Find μ.","We are asked to find the mean power μ (in dBm) such that there is a 1% outage probability, given:

- Outage threshold: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal fading: \( \sigma = 12 \, \text{dB} \)
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 1\% = 0.01 \)

This is a classic problem in wireless communications involving log-normal shadowing.

---

### Step 1: Model the received power
The received power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
In logarithmic scale (dBm), it becomes:
\[
X = 10 \log_{10}(P_r) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

Outage occurs when \( X < P_{\text{th}} \), i.e., when the received power drops below 10 dBm.

So,
\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(X < 10) = \Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.01
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \mu \)

We know:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{12} \right) = 0.01
\]

From standard normal tables or using a calculator:
\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.01) \approx -2.326
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{10 - \mu}{12} = -2.326
\]

Multiply both sides by 12:
\[
10 - \mu = -27.912
\]

Solve for \( \mu \):
\[
\mu = 10 + 27.912 = 37.912 \, \text{dBm}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\mu \approx 37.91 \, \text{dBm}

"Free-space path loss. Isotropic antennas, f=2 GHz, d=50 m. Required P_r=-60 dBm. Find required transmit power P_t (W) using P_r=P_t(λ/(4πd))^2.","We are given:

- Frequency \( f = 2 \) GHz  
- Distance \( d = 50 \) m  
- Received power \( P_r = -60 \) dBm  
- Isotropic antennas  
- Free-space path loss formula:  
  \[
  P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
  \]

---

### Step 1: Convert frequency to wavelength
The speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s  
Wavelength \( \lambda = \frac{c}{f} \)

\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 10^9} = 0.15 \text{ m}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the formula

\[
P_r = P_t \left( \frac{0.15}{4\pi \times 50} \right)^2
\]

First compute the term inside the parentheses:

\[
\frac{0.15}{4\pi \times 50} = \frac{0.15}{200\pi} \approx \frac{0.15}{628.32} \approx 0.0002387
\]

Now square it:

\[
\left( 0.0002387 \right)^2 \approx 5.697 \times 10^{-8}
\]

So:
\[
P_r = P_t \times 5.697 \times 10^{-8}
\]

But we are given \( P_r = -60 \) dBm  
Convert this to watts (since the equation uses linear units):

\[
P_r (\text{W}) = 10^{(-60)/10} \times 10^{-3} = 10^{-6} \text{ W} = 1 \mu\text{W}
\]

(Since −60 dBm = 10⁻⁶ W)

Now solve for \( P_t \):

\[
1 \times 10^{-6} = P_t \times 5.697 \times 10^{-8}
\]

\[
P_t = \frac{1 \times 10^{-6}}{5.697 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 17.55 \text{ W}

"Log-normal outage. Mean μ=15 dBm, σ=8 dB, threshold 5 dBm. Compute outage probability.","To compute the **outage probability** for a log-normal shadowing model, we follow these steps:

---

### Given:
- **Mean of the underlying normal distribution (in dB):**  
  μ = 15 dBm  
- **Standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution (in dB):**  
  σ = 8 dB  
- **Threshold (minimum acceptable power level):**  
  P_th = 5 dBm  

The received signal power \( P \) is **log-normally distributed**, meaning \( \log_{10}(P) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), where values are in dBm.

Outage occurs when \( P < P_{\text{th}} \). So the outage probability is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P < P_{\text{th}}) = \Pr(\log_{10}(P) < \log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}))
\]

Since \( \log_{10}(P) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), this becomes a standard normal CDF evaluation:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]

Plug in the numbers:

- \( \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.69897 \)  
- \( \mu = 15 \)  
- \( \sigma = 8 \)

So:

\[
z = \frac{0.69897 - 15}{8} = \frac{-14.30103}{8} \approx -1.7876
\]

Now find the cumulative standard normal distribution at \( z = -1.7876 \):

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi(-1.7876) \approx 1 - \Phi(1.7876)
\]

From standard normal tables or using a calculator:

- \( \Phi(1.7876) \approx 0.9633 \)  
- So: \( \Phi(-1.7876) \approx 1 - 0.9633 = 0.0367 \)

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{P_{\text{out}} \approx 3.67\%}

\[

where \( p_b = 10^{-3} \), and \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) (in linear scale).

Our goal is to estimate the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation

\[
10^{-3} = \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right)
\]

Divide both sides by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{4}{3000} = \frac{1}{750}
\]

So we need to find \( x \) such that:

\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{750}
\]

---

### Step 2: Use inverse Q-function

We need the inverse of the Q-function, \( Q^{-1}(1/750) \).  
This value can be approximated using standard tables or numerical methods.

From common Q-function values or a calculator:

- \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.00135 \)
- \( Q(3.1) \approx 0.000968 \)
- \( Q(3.2) \approx 0.000687 \)

We want \( Q(x) = 1/750 \approx 0.001333 \)

This is between \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.00135 \) and \( Q(3.1) \approx 0.000968 \)

Interpolate roughly:

Let’s use linear interpolation between 3.0 and 3.1:

At \( x = 3.0 \), \( Q = 0.00135 \)  
At \( x = 3.1 \), \( Q = 0.000968 \)

Target: \( Q = 0.001333 \)

Difference from 3.0:
\[
\Delta Q = 0.00135 - 0.001333 = 0.000017
\]
Total drop over 0.1 unit: \( 0.00135 - 0.000968 = 0.000382 \)

Fraction: \( \frac{0.000017}{0.000382} \approx 0.0445 \)

So:
\[
x \approx 3.0 + 0.0445 \times 0.1 = 3.0 + 0.00445 \approx 3.0045
\]

Alternatively, more accurately, use known values or software:
- \( Q^{-1}(0.001333) \approx 3.00 \) (very close)

But since 0.001333 is slightly less than 0.00135, we should take \( x \approx 3.01 \)

From precise calculation (or using inverse Q-function approximations):

\[
Q^{-1}(1/750) \approx 3.00 \quad \text{(very close)}
\]

For better accuracy, let's compute with better precision:

Use the approximation:

\[
Q(x) \approx \frac{1}{2} \text{erfc}\left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
\]

We can solve numerically:

Try \( x = 3.00 \):  
\( Q(3.00) \approx 0.0013499 \) (matches closely with 1/750 ≈ 0.001333)

So:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \approx 3.00
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \gamma_b = E_b/N_0 \)

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} = 3.00
\Rightarrow \frac{4}{5} \gamma_b = 9.00
\Rightarrow \gamma_b = \frac{9 \times 5}{4} = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25
\]

---

### Step 4: Convert to dB

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(11.25) \approx 10 \times 1.051 \approx 10.51 \text{ dB}

- \( N_0 \) is the noise power spectral density.

Given:  
\( P_b = 0.01 \)

We want to find \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Solve for the argument of the Q-function

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 0.01
\]

Take the inverse Q-function (also known as the quantile function):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(0.01)
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q^{-1}(0.01) \approx 2.326
\]

So:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 2.326
\]

### Step 2: Square both sides

\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (2.326)^2 \approx 5.41
\]

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5.41}{2} \approx 2.705

   2^{-40} = \frac{1}{2^{40}} \approx \frac{1}{1.0995 \times 10^{12}} \approx 9.0949 \times 10^{-13}

\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 3400 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 3400 \times \log_2(101)

A 6 kHz bandpass channel uses 8PSK under η=0.5 log2(M). Find max bit rate.,"We are given:

- A **6 kHz bandpass channel**
- Modulation: **8PSK** (8 Phase Shift Keying)
- The relationship between spectral efficiency and modulation:  
  \[
  \eta = 0.5 \log_2(M)
  \]
  where \( M = 8 \) for 8PSK.

We are to find the **maximum bit rate**.

---

### Step 1: Understand Spectral Efficiency
The formula given:
\[
\eta = 0.5 \log_2(M)
\]
is a known expression for the **maximum spectral efficiency** (in bits/second/Hz) of a bandpass signal using **M-PSK** modulation under ideal conditions (e.g., Nyquist criterion, no ISI).

For 8PSK, \( M = 8 \), so:
\[
\log_2(8) = 3
\]
\[
\eta = 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5 \text{ bits/second/Hz}
\]

This means the system can transmit up to 1.5 bits per second per hertz of bandwidth.

---

### Step 2: Apply to Channel Bandwidth
Channel bandwidth \( B = 6 \text{ kHz} = 6000 \text{ Hz} \)

Maximum bit rate \( R \) is:
\[
R = \eta \times B = 1.5 \times 6000 = 9000 \text{ bps}

- Required output SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio):  
  \( \text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} = 10^{30/10} = 1000 \)

- One-sided noise power spectral density:  
  \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

- Modulating tone frequency:  
  \( f_m = 4 \, \text{kHz} = 4000 \, \text{Hz} \)

- Modulation efficiency:  
  \( \eta = 0.25 \)

We are to find the **required input signal power** \( S_i \), using synchronous detection in AM.

---

### Step 1: Compute input noise power \( N_i \)
For a single-tone AM signal, the input noise power in the bandwidth of the message is:

\[
N_i = n_0 \cdot 2f_m
\]

\[
N_i = (2 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 2 \cdot 4000 = 2 \times 10^{-10} \cdot 8000 = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{W}
\]

So:
\[
N_i = 1.6 \, \mu\text{W}
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute modulation index squared \( \beta^2 \)

Given:
\[
\beta^2 = \frac{2\eta}{1 - \eta}
\]

Plug in \( \eta = 0.25 \):

\[
\beta^2 = \frac{2 \cdot 0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \frac{0.5}{0.75} = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute AM system gain \( G_{AM} \)

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{2\beta^2}{2 + \beta^2}
\]

Substitute \( \beta^2 = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2}{3}}{2 + \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}}{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5
\]

So:
\[
G_{AM} = 0.5
\]

---

### Step 4: Compute required input signal power \( S_i \)

Using the formula:

\[
S_i = \frac{\text{SNR}_o \cdot N_i}{G_{AM}}
\]

Plug in values:

\[
S_i = \frac{1000 \cdot 1.6 \times 10^{-6}}{0.5} = \frac{1.6 \times 10^{-3}}{0.5} = 3.2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W}

So:
\[
S_i = 3.2 \, \text{mW}

- Baseband bandwidth \( B = 44.8 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.4 \)
- QPSK modulation:  
  - Symbol rate \( R_s \) (baud rate)  
  - Bit rate \( R_b = 2R_s \) (since each symbol carries 2 bits)

The formula for the required baseband bandwidth for a raised cosine filter is:

\[
B = \frac{(1 + \alpha) R_s}{2}
\]

We need to solve for \( R_s \), then find \( R_b = 2R_s \).

---

### Step 1: Solve for \( R_s \)

From the bandwidth equation:

\[
B = \frac{(1 + \alpha) R_s}{2}
\]

Plug in known values:

\[
44.8 \times 10^3 = \frac{(1 + 0.4) R_s}{2}

\[
44.8 \times 10^3 = \frac{1.4 R_s}{2}

Coherent BPSK with carrier phase offset φ. Decision statistic means are ±A cosφ. What is optimal decision threshold (equal priors)?,"For Coherent BPSK with a carrier phase offset \( \phi \), the decision statistic (received signal after matched filtering or correlation) has means:

- Under \( s_0(t) = -A \cos(\omega_c t + \phi) \): mean = \( -A \cos\phi \)
- Under \( s_1(t) = A \cos(\omega_c t + \phi) \): mean = \( +A \cos\phi \)

Since the noise is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), the decision statistic follows a Gaussian distribution under each hypothesis.

With **equal priors**, the optimal decision threshold \( \gamma \) minimizes the total probability of error. This occurs at the **midpoint between the two means** — because the likelihoods are symmetric and priors are equal.

Given:
- \(\sqrt{E_b/N_0} = 0.02\)
- Approximation: \( Q(x) \approx 0.5 - \frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \)

---

### Step 1: BER for coherent 2ASK
For coherent 2ASK, the BER is:

\[
P_b \approx Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

But note that in many sources, 2ASK is equivalent to BPSK in terms of performance when using coherent detection — so the standard expression is:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

However, sometimes it's written as just \( Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right) \), depending on energy per bit definition. But the correct form for **coherent 2ASK** (where one symbol is 0 and the other is \(\sqrt{2E_b}\)) is:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

So we must compute:

\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 0.02
\]

Calculate that:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \times 0.02 \approx 1.4142 \times 0.02 = 0.028284
\]

---

### Step 2: Use the approximation

Use:
\[
Q(x) \approx 0.5 - \frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
\]

First compute \(\sqrt{2\pi}\):

\[
\sqrt{2\pi} \approx \sqrt{6.2832} \approx 2.5066
\]

Now plug in:

\[
Q(0.028284) \approx 0.5 - \frac{0.028284}{2.5066} \approx 0.5 - 0.01129 \approx 0.4887

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[

- Double-sided noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( E_b \)
For 2ASK (binary ASK), each symbol carries 1 bit. So,
\[
E_b = \frac{A^2}{4R_s}
\]
Substitute values:
\[
E_b = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-3})^2}{4 \times 2 \times 10^6} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^6} = \frac{4}{8} \times 10^{-12} = 0.5 \times 10^{-12} = 5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( N_0 \)
The single-sided noise power spectral density is:
\[
N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

Note: In many communications contexts, \( N_0 \) refers to single-sided PSD — this is correct as per the problem’s instruction.

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-13}}{5 \times 10^{-11}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{P_b \approx 0.460}

This is an unreasonably high BER — it suggests poor signal quality. This happens because:
- The received amplitude (2 mV) is very small.
- The noise PSD is also low but not enough to compensate for the weak signal.
- This corresponds to a very low \( E_b/N_0 = 10^{-2} \) (i.e., -20 dB), which is far below typical acceptable thresholds for reliable communication.

"Water-filling normalized power allocation. Cutoff γ_0=0.8. For state γ=0.5, compute S(γ)/S.","To compute \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) for a water-filling normalized power allocation with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \) and state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), we proceed as follows:

---

### **Key Concepts:**
- In water-filling power allocation, the power allocated to a channel with SNR \( \gamma \) is:
  \[
  P(\gamma) = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right)^+
  \]
  where \( (x)^+ = \max(x, 0) \).

- The total average power \( S \) (or system power) is:
  \[
  S = \int_0^\infty P(\gamma) f_\gamma(\gamma) \, d\gamma
  \]
  assuming \( f_\gamma(\gamma) \) is the probability density function of \( \gamma \). But since we are computing a normalized ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \), we can work in terms of the **normalized power allocation**.

- For the normalized case, often the total power is normalized such that \( S = 1 \), and the per-state power \( S(\gamma) \) refers to the amount of power allocated to a channel with SNR \( \gamma \), normalized by the total power.

However, the problem likely refers to the following interpretation:

> In water-filling, the normalized power allocated to a channel with SNR \( \gamma \) is:
\[
S(\gamma) = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right)^+ \cdot \frac{1}{\text{Total Normalized Power}}
\]

But given that \( \gamma = 0.5 < \gamma_0 = 0.8 \), the water-filling policy does **not allocate any power** to this channel — because only channels with \( \gamma \geq \gamma_0 \) receive power.

Thus:
\[
P(\gamma) = \left( \frac{1}{0.8} - \frac{1}{0.5} \right)^+ = (1.25 - 2)^+ = (-0.75)^+ = 0
\]

So, the power allocated to this channel is zero.

Therefore:
\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0}{S} = 0

"Compute required modulation order. In same channel (B=4 kHz, α=0.5), need R_b=16 kbit/s. What minimum M (power of 2) is needed?","We are given:

- Channel bandwidth \( B = 4 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.5 \)  
- Required bit rate \( R_b = 16 \) kbit/s  

We need to find the **minimum modulation order \( M \)** (a power of 2) that satisfies this requirement.

---

### Step 1: Calculate maximum achievable symbol rate \( R_s \)

For a channel with roll-off factor \( \alpha \), the maximum symbol rate is:

\[
R_s = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Substitute values:

\[
R_s = \frac{4\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.5} = \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.6667\ \text{kSymbols/s}
\]

---

### Step 2: Determine bits per symbol required

We need to transmit \( R_b = 16 \) kbit/s using symbol rate \( R_s \approx 2.6667 \) kSymbols/s.

So, the number of bits per symbol \( r \) must satisfy:

\[
r = \frac{R_b}{R_s} = \frac{16}{8/3} = 16 \times \frac{3}{8} = 6\ \text{bits/symbol}
\]

---

### Step 3: Find minimum \( M \) such that \( \log_2 M \geq r \)

We need \( \log_2 M \geq 6 \Rightarrow M \geq 2^6 = 64 \)

Since we want the **minimum power of 2**, and 64 is already a power of 2:

\[
M = 64
\]

"FSK modem Eb/N0 from SNR. Bit rate R_b=600 bit/s, channel bandwidth B=3000 Hz, input SNR=3 dB. Compute E_b/N_0=(S/N)*(B/R_b).","To compute the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio \( E_b/N_0 \), we use the formula:

\[
E_b/N_0 = \left(\frac{S}{N}\right) \times \left(\frac{B}{R_b}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( \frac{S}{N} \) = input SNR in linear scale (not dB),
- \( B \) = channel bandwidth = 3000 Hz,
- \( R_b \) = bit rate = 600 bit/s.

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale
Given:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}} = 3 \, \text{dB}
\]
Convert to linear:
\[
\frac{S}{N} = 10^{(3/10)} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the formula
\[
E_b/N_0 = 2 \times \frac{3000}{600} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
E_b/N_0 = 10 \quad \text{(linear)}

In dB:
\[
E_b/N_0 = 10 \log_{10}(10) = 10 \, \text{dB}

"Compute correlation threshold spacing. For exponential PDP with τ_rms=1 μs, find Δf such that |R(Δf)|<0.3 using |R|=1/\sqrt{1+(2πΔf τ_rms)^2}.","We are given:

- The autocorrelation function for an exponential power delay profile (PDP):  
  \[
  |R(\Delta f)| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2}}
  \]
- \( \tau_{\text{rms}} = 1 \, \mu\text{s} = 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \)
- We want to find the frequency spacing \( \Delta f \) such that:
  \[
  |R(\Delta f)| < 0.3
  \]

---

### Step 1: Set up inequality

We solve:
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2}} < 0.3
\]

Take reciprocals (note: both sides positive, so inequality flips):
\[
\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2} > \frac{1}{0.3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.333...
\]

Now square both sides:
\[
1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2 > \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{100}{9}
\]

Subtract 1:
\[
(2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2 > \frac{100}{9} - 1 = \frac{91}{9}
\]

Take square root:
\[
2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}} > \sqrt{\frac{91}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{91}}{3}
\]

Solve for \( \Delta f \):
\[
\Delta f > \frac{\sqrt{91}}{3 \cdot 2\pi \tau_{\text{rms}}} = \frac{\sqrt{91}}{6\pi \tau_{\text{rms}}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug in values

- \( \tau_{\text{rms}} = 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \)
- \( \sqrt{91} \approx 9.539 \)

So:
\[
\Delta f > \frac{9.539}{6\pi \times 10^{-6}} 
= \frac{9.539}{6 \times 3.1416 \times 10^{-6}} 
\approx \frac{9.539}{18.8496 \times 10^{-6}} 
\approx \frac{9.539}{1.88496 \times 10^{-5}} 
\approx 506.1 \, \text{kHz}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\Delta f > 506 \, \text{kHz}
\]

So, the correlation threshold spacing is **greater than 506 kHz** — meaning any frequency spacing larger than this will ensure the correlation magnitude drops below 0.3.",101000.0,0.0,0.0689215000000001
"A cubic amplifier two-tone test: at input -10 dBm, desired output 15 dBm and IM3 output -25 dBm. Estimate IIP3.","To estimate the Third-Order Intercept Point (IIP3) from a two-tone test, we use the relationship between the fundamental signal power, the third-order intermodulation product (IM3), and the IIP3.

### Given:
- Input power (each tone): \( P_{\text{in}} = -10 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Desired output (fundamental): \( P_{\text{out, fund}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- IM3 output: \( P_{\text{out, IM3}} = -25 \, \text{dBm} \)

We first compute the **gain** of the amplifier:

\[
G = P_{\text{out, fund}} - P_{\text{in}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} - (-10 \, \text{dBm}) = 25 \, \text{dB}
\]

Now, convert the IM3 output power to the **input-referred IM3 power** by subtracting the gain:

\[
P_{\text{in, IM3}} = P_{\text{out, IM3}} - G = -25 \, \text{dBm} - 25 \, \text{dB} = -50 \, \text{dBm}
\]

The IIP3 is defined as the input power level where the extrapolated fundamental and IM3 powers would intersect. For small signals, the IM3 power increases at 3× the rate of the fundamental — so the difference in dB between the fundamental and IM3 at any point is:

\[
\Delta = P_{\text{in, fund}} - P_{\text{in, IM3}} = (-10 \, \text{dBm}) - (-50 \, \text{dBm}) = 40 \, \text{dB}
\]

The IIP3 is then given by:

\[
\text{IIP3} = P_{\text{in, fund}} + \frac{\Delta}{2} = -10 \, \text{dBm} + \frac{40 \, \text{dB}}{2} = -10 \, \text{dBm} + 20 \, \text{dB} = 10 \, \text{dBm}

"Antipodal (bipolar) signaling BER. For antipodal signaling, P_b=Q(\sqrt{2E_b/N_0}). If E_b/N_0=7 (linear), compute P_b.","For antipodal (bipolar) signaling, the bit error rate (BER) is given by:

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2E_b/N_0}\right)
\]

Given:
\[
E_b/N_0 = 7 \quad \text{(linear scale)}
\]

First, compute the argument of the Q-function:

\[
\sqrt{2E_b/N_0} = \sqrt{2 \times 7} = \sqrt{14} \approx 3.7417

Now, evaluate the Q-function at 3.7417:

The Q-function is defined as:
\[

Matched filter for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Find h(t)=s(T-t).,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

This represents a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \). So it's a pulse of duration \( \frac{T}{3} \).

We are asked to find the matched filter impulse response:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

---

### Step 1: Understand \( s(T - t) \)

Substitute \( T - t \) into \( s(\cdot) \):

\[
h(t) = s(T - t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( (T - t) - \frac{T}{3} \right) \right]
\]

Simplify the second unit step argument:

\[
(T - t) - \frac{T}{3} = \frac{2T}{3} - t
\]

So:

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right]
\]

---

### Step 2: Interpret the expression

Recall that \( U(a - t) = 1 \) when \( t \leq a \), and 0 otherwise.

So:
- \( U(T - t) = 1 \) for \( t \leq T \)
- \( U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) = 1 \) for \( t \leq \frac{2T}{3} \)

Therefore, the difference:

- For \( t < \frac{2T}{3} \): both terms are 1 → difference is 0
- For \( \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \): first term is 1, second is 0 → difference is 1
- For \( t > T \): both are 0 → difference is 0

Hence, \( h(t) \) is a rectangular pulse that starts at \( t = \frac{2T}{3} \) and ends at \( t = T \), with amplitude \( A \).

---

### Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{h(t) = A \left[ U\left(t - \frac{2T}{3}\right) - U(t - T) \right]}

### Step 1: Recall the definition of SNR
The input SNR is defined as:

\[
\text{SNR} = \frac{P_s}{N_i}
\]

Given:
\[
\text{SNR} = 0.05, \quad P_s = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W}, \quad N_i = n_0 B
\]

Substitute into the equation:

\[
0.05 = \frac{2 \times 10^{-3}}{n_0 \cdot 4000}
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( n_0 \)

Multiply both sides by \( n_0 \cdot 4000 \):

\[

\[

Where:
- \( A_c = 6 \, \text{V} \) (carrier amplitude)
- \( f_c = 1 \, \text{MHz} = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \) (carrier frequency)
- \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} = 5 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \) (modulating frequency)
- \( A_m = 2 \, \text{V} \) (amplitude of the message signal)
- \( K_{FM} = 4 \, \text{kHz/V} = 4 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz/V} \) (frequency sensitivity)

Assume the message signal is:
\[
m(t) = A_m \cos(2\pi f_m t) = 2 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5000 \cdot t)

Now compute the integral:
\[

= \frac{2}{2\pi f_m} \sin(2\pi f_m t) 
= \frac{1}{\pi f_m} \sin(2\pi f_m t)
\]

Substitute into the FM expression:
\[
s_{FM}(t) = 6 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 10^6 \cdot t + 2\pi \cdot (4 \times 10^3) \cdot \frac{1}{\pi f_m} \sin(2\pi f_m t) \right)

Plug in \( f_m = 5000 \):
\[
\frac{2 \cdot 4 \times 10^3}{5000} = \frac{8000}{5000} = 1.6

"If synchronized to the second path (50 ns) for same delays {0,50,120} ns, find T_m.","To find \( T_m \) (the minimum clock period or the maximum delay in a synchronous circuit), we need to analyze the timing constraints given:

- Delays on two paths:  
  Path 1: {0, 50, 120} ns  
  Path 2: Synchronized to the second path with a 50 ns delay — so it's likely the delays on the second path are also {0, 50, 120}, but **offset by 50 ns**.

But since both paths are synchronized to the same ""second path"" and have the same set of delays {0, 50, 120} ns, it implies that both paths experience the same internal delays — but perhaps their timing is aligned relative to a common clock edge.

Alternatively, if ""synchronized to the second path (50 ns)"" means that the second path has an additional fixed delay of 50 ns compared to the first, then:

Let’s assume:
- Path 1 has delays: 0, 50, 120 ns → total delay = 170 ns
- Path 2 has delays: 0, 50, 120 ns + 50 ns offset → meaning its total delay is 170 + 50 = 220 ns

However, synchronization usually refers to aligning arrival times at a register or flip-flop. If both paths are synchronized to the same clock edge (i.e., their data must arrive within the same clock cycle), then the worst-case delay determines the minimum clock period \( T_m \).

So, if both paths are required to meet setup time constraints for the same clock, then:

\[
T_m = \text{maximum path delay}
\]

Given the delays are the same for both paths ({0, 50, 120}), but one is synchronized to the second path with a 50 ns offset — this might imply that one path is delayed by 50 ns more than the other.

If the problem is asking:  
> ""If synchronized to the second path (50 ns) for same delays {0, 50, 120} ns"",  
then likely it means both paths have the same delay structure, but one path is 50 ns behind the other (i.e., there's a 50 ns skew between them). But since they're synchronized, the effective timing constraint is based on the longest path.

Thus, total delay per path = 0 + 50 + 120 = 170 ns.

Since both paths are synchronized to the clock, the worst-case delay determines the minimum clock period:

We are asked to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB such that \( P_b = 10^{-3} \).

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-3}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-3}
\]

We need to solve for \( x \) such that the Q-function equals \( 10^{-3} \).

---

### Step 2: Use inverse Q-function (or standard values)

From tables or standard Q-function approximations:

\[
Q(3.09) \approx 10^{-3}
\]

So,
\[
x = 3.09 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = 3.09

Find required received power P_r.","We are asked to compute the required received power \( P_r \) for DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) given:

- Target Bit Error Rate (BER): \( P_b = 10^{-4} \)
- Bit rate: \( R_b = 1 \, \text{Mbit/s} = 10^6 \, \text{bits/s} \)
- One-sided noise power spectral density: \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- DBPSK BER formula:  
  \[
  P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
  \]

---

### Step 1: Solve for \( E_b / N_0 \)

From the BER equation:
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]
Plug in \( P_b = 10^{-4} \):
\[
10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
2 \times 10^{-4} = e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = -\frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

Compute:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-4}) = \ln(2) - 4 \ln(10)
\]
\[
\approx 0.6931 - 4 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 9.2104 = -8.5173
\]

So:
\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = -8.5173 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 8.5173
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( E_b \)

Recall that:
\[
E_b = \frac{P_r}{R_b}
\]
So:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{P_r}{R_b N_0}
\]

Now plug in known values:
\[
\frac{P_r}{R_b N_0} = 8.5173
\]

Solve for \( P_r \):
\[
P_r = 8.5173 \times R_b \times N_0
\]

Substitute:
- \( R_b = 10^6 \, \text{bit/s} \)
- \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

\[
P_r = 8.5173 \times 10^6 \times 2 \times 10^{-20}

\[
= 8.5173 \times 2 \times 10^{-14}

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bit/s)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

We are given:
- \( C = 20 \, \text{kbit/s} = 20,000 \, \text{bit/s} \)
- \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3400 \, \text{Hz} \)

"For the same amplifier, what is the output power when IM3 equals desired?","When the **third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3)** equals the **desired signal level**, the output power is typically referred to as the **Output Power at 1 dB Compression Point (OP1dB)** or sometimes approximated as the point where IM3 = Desired Signal Level.

This condition occurs near the **compression region** of the amplifier, where nonlinearities become significant. At this point:

- The desired signal power (e.g., from a single tone or two-tone test) is such that the third-order products (IM3) are equal in amplitude to the desired signal.
- This is often considered the **linear operating limit** of the amplifier — beyond this point, distortion increases rapidly, and the amplifier starts to compress the signal.

### Key Insight:
In practice, when IM3 = Desired Signal Level (in dB), it means:

\[
\text{IM3} = \text{Desired Output Power}
\]

This corresponds to an **Intercept Point (IP3)** relationship. Specifically, if \( P_{\text{out}} \) is the output power of the desired signal, then:

\[
\text{IP3} = P_{\text{out}} + \frac{\Delta}{2}
\]

Where \( \Delta \) is the difference between the desired signal and IM3 in dB — but since they are equal here, \( \Delta = 0 \). Therefore, this point is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \text{IP3}
\]

Wait — that’s not quite right. Let’s clarify:

For two tones at power \( P_{\text{in}} \), the IM3 (at 2f₁ - f₂ or similar) appears at a level:

\[
P_{\text{IM3}} = 3P_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IP3}
\]

At the point where IM3 = Desired Signal (which is 2×P_in for two tones), you get:

\[
3P_{\text{in}} - 2\cdot \text{IP3} = 2P_{\text{in}}
\Rightarrow P_{\text{in}} = 2 \cdot \text{IP3}
\]

Then the output power \( P_{\text{out}} \) (for the input tone) is approximately:

\[
P_{\text{out}} \approx \text{IP3} + \frac{1}{2} \times \text{gain}
\]

But the most direct answer in terms of common usage:

---

✅ **Answer**:  
When IM3 equals the desired signal level (i.e., IM3 = Desired Output Power), the output power is approximately the **1 dB compression point (OP1dB)** — which is typically about **3–4 dB below the IP3 value** for many amplifiers.

Net bits per subcarrier symbol =  
(bits per subcarrier from modulation) × (coding rate)  
= 6 bits × (3/4)  
= 4.5 bits

✅ Final Answer: **4.5 net bits per subcarrier symbol**",4.5,1.0,0.06087765000000006
"Free-space path loss. Isotropic antennas, f=2 GHz, d=50 m. Required P_r=-60 dBm. Find required transmit power P_t (W) using P_r=P_t(λ/(4πd))^2.","We are given:

- Frequency \( f = 2 \) GHz  
- Distance \( d = 50 \) m  
- Received power \( P_r = -60 \) dBm  
- Antennas are isotropic  
- Path loss formula:  
  \[
  P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
  \]

We need to find the required transmit power \( P_t \) in watts.

---

### Step 1: Convert \( P_r \) from dBm to watts

\[
P_r = -60 \, \text{dBm} = 10^{-60/10} \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W} = 10^{-9} \, \text{W}
\]

(Recall: 0 dBm = 1 mW = \(10^{-3}\) W, so \( -60 \, \text{dBm} = 10^{-6} \, \text{mW} = 10^{-9} \, \text{W} \))

So:
\[
P_r = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W}
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute wavelength \( \lambda \)

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}} = 0.15 \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Step 3: Plug into the path loss formula

\[
P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
\]

Solve for \( P_t \):

\[
P_t = P_r \left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)^2
\]

Substitute values:

- \( P_r = 10^{-9} \)
- \( d = 50 \)
- \( \lambda = 0.15 \)

First compute:

\[
\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} = \frac{4 \pi \cdot 50}{0.15} = \frac{200\pi}{0.15} = \frac{200 \cdot 3.1416}{0.15} \approx \frac{628.32}{0.15} \approx 4188.8
\]

Now square it:

\[
\left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)^2 \approx (4188.8)^2 \approx 17,543,000
\]

Now compute \( P_t \):

\[
P_t = 10^{-9} \times 17,543,000 = 1.7543 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{W}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{P_t = 17.54 \, \text{mW}}
\]

or in watts:

\[
\boxed{P_t = 0.01754 \, \text{W}}

"FM SNR improvement. For β=4.5, compute G_FM=3β^2(1+β).","We are given:

- β = 4.5  
- Formula for FM SNR improvement:  
  \[
  G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta)
  \]

### Step 1: Compute β²
\[
\beta^2 = (4.5)^2 = 20.25
\]

### Step 2: Compute (1 + β)
\[
1 + \beta = 1 + 4.5 = 5.5
\]

### Step 3: Multiply all together
\[
G_{\text{FM}} = 3 \times 20.25 \times 5.5
\]

First, multiply 20.25 × 5.5:
\[
20.25 \times 5.5 = (20 \times 5.5) + (0.25 \times 5.5) = 110 + 1.375 = 111.375
\]

Now multiply by 3:
\[
G_{\text{FM}} = 3 \times 111.375 = 334.125
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
G_{\text{FM}} = 334.125

Chip rate is 2 Mcps and m-sequence period is 31 chips. Find period time.,"To find the **period time** of an m-sequence (maximum-length sequence), we need to determine how long it takes to transmit one full period of the sequence.

Given:

- **Chip rate** = 2 Mcps = 2 × 10⁶ chips per second  
- **m-sequence period** = 31 chips

### Step 1: Time for one chip
Time per chip =  
\[
\frac{1}{\text{chip rate}} = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^6} = 0.5 \, \mu\text{s}
\]

### Step 2: Period time = time for one full sequence
Since the sequence has 31 chips:

\[
\text{Period time} = 31 \times 0.5 \, \mu\text{s} = 15.5 \, \mu\text{s}
\]
