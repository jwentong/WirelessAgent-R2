Channel capacity with SNR=0.5 (linear) and bandwidth B=1 MHz. Compute C in Mbit/s.,"To compute the channel capacity \( C \) in Mbit/s, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB).

Given:
- \( B = 1 \, \text{MHz} = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( \text{SNR} = 0.5 \)

Plug into the formula:

\[
C = 10^6 \cdot \log_2(1 + 0.5) = 10^6 \cdot \log_2(1.5)
\]

Now calculate \( \log_2(1.5) \):

\[
\log_2(1.5) = \frac{\log_{10}(1.5)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.1761}{0.3010} \approx 0.585
\]

So:

\[
C \approx 10^6 \cdot 0.585 = 585,000 \, \text{bit/s} = 0.585 \, \text{Mbit/s}

Free-space constant K=(λ/(4πd0))^2 with d0=1 m. For f_c=1 GHz compute K.,"We are given:

- Free-space constant:  
  \[
  K = \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_0} \right)^2
  \]
- Reference distance: \( d_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \)
- Carrier frequency: \( f_c = 1 \, \text{GHz} = 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)

### Step 1: Compute the wavelength \( \lambda \)
The wavelength in free space is:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c}
\]
where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

So,
\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{10^9} = 0.3 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Plug into the formula for \( K \)
\[
K = \left( \frac{0.3}{4\pi \cdot 1} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{0.3}{4\pi} \right)^2
\]

First compute \( \frac{0.3}{4\pi} \):
\[
\frac{0.3}{4\pi} = \frac{0.3}{12.5664} \approx 0.02388
\]

Now square it:
\[
K \approx (0.02388)^2 \approx 0.0005703
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{K \approx 5.703 \times 10^{-4}}

"For coherent OOK with A=1, N0=0.5, P1=0.2, P2=0.8, compute V_T.","To compute the optimal threshold voltage \( V_T \) for coherent On-Off Keying (OOK) with given parameters, we use the standard formula derived from minimizing the probability of error in binary detection.

For coherent OOK:

- \( A = 1 \): signal amplitude (for ""1"")
- \( N_0 = 0.5 \): noise power spectral density
- \( P_1 = 0.2 \): probability of transmitting symbol ""1""
- \( P_0 = 0.8 \): probability of transmitting symbol ""0"" (since \( P_0 + P_1 = 1 \))

The optimal threshold \( V_T \) for minimum probability of error is given by:

\[
V_T = \frac{A^2}{2N_0} \ln\left(\frac{P_0}{P_1}\right)
\]

**Step-by-step substitution:**

1. \( A^2 = 1^2 = 1 \)
2. \( N_0 = 0.5 \), so \( \frac{A^2}{2N_0} = \frac{1}{2 \times 0.5} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \)
3. \( \frac{P_0}{P_1} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \)
4. \( \ln(4) = \ln(2^2) = 2 \ln(2) \approx 2 \times 0.6931 = 1.3862 \)

"Coherent OOK inversion. For equal priors and P_b=10^{-2}, find required E_b/N_0 in dB for P_b=Q(\sqrt{E_b/N_0}).","We are given:

- Coherent On–Off Keying (OOK)
- Equal priors (i.e., P(0) = P(1) = 0.5)
- Bit error probability: \( P_b = 10^{-2} \)
- The bit error probability is modeled as:  
  \[
  P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)
  \]

We are to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Use the given formula
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-2}
\]

So:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 0.01
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \)

We need to find the value \( x \) such that:
\[
Q(x) = 0.01
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:
\[
Q(2.326) \approx 0.01

So:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = 2.326

### Step 3: Square both sides

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = (2.326)^2 \approx 5.41

"For RC shaping with α=0.3 and bandwidth 41.6 kHz, find max QPSK bit rate.","To find the maximum QPSK bit rate for an RC (Raised Cosine) filter with α = 0.3 and a bandwidth of 41.6 kHz, we follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship
For a Raised Cosine filter, the **symbol rate** \( R_s \) (in symbols per second) is related to the bandwidth \( B \) by:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

This formula assumes baseband transmission (no carrier modulation — but it's the same for both baseband and passband in terms of symbol rate).

We are given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 41.6 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.3 \)

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
= \frac{2 \times 41.6}{1 + 0.3}
= \frac{83.2}{1.3}

Energy of s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Compute E.,"We are given the signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

where:
- \( A \) is a constant,
- \( U(t) \) is the unit step function (Heaviside function),
- \( T \) is a positive constant.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Signal
The expression \( U(t) - U(t - T/3) \) represents a rectangular pulse of width \( T/3 \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = T/3 \).

So, \( s(t) \) is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \) lasting from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = T/3 \), and zero elsewhere.

Thus, we can write:
\[
s(t) =
\begin{cases}
A, & 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{3} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

---

### Step 2: Energy of a Signal
The energy \( E \) of a continuous-time signal \( s(t) \) is defined as:

\[
E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |s(t)|^2 \, dt
\]

Since \( s(t) \) is real-valued, \( |s(t)|^2 = s(t)^2 \). Also, \( s(t) = 0 \) outside \( [0, T/3] \), so the integral reduces to:

\[
E = \int_0^{T/3} A^2 \, dt = A^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T}{3} \right)

Estimate BER using P_b=Q(\sqrt{E_b/N0}) and E_b=A^2/(4R_s), N0=n0/2.","We are asked to estimate the Bit Error Rate (BER) for a 2ASK (coherent) system using the formula:

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]

with given parameters:

- Symbol rate \( R_s = 2 \times 10^6 \) baud  
- Received amplitude \( A = 2 \, \text{mV} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{V} \)  
- Double-sided noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

### Step 1: Compute \( E_b \)
For 2ASK (binary amplitude shift keying), the energy per bit is:

\[
E_b = \frac{A^2}{4R_s}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
E_b = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-3})^2}{4 \times 2 \times 10^6} = \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^6} = \frac{4}{8} \times 10^{-12} = 0.5 \times 10^{-12} = 5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( N_0 \)
The single-sided noise PSD is:

\[
N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

(Units of \( N_0 \) are W/Hz — same as power per Hz; since \( E_b \) is in Joules (energy), and \( N_0 \) is power spectral density, the ratio \( E_b / N_0 \) is dimensionless.)

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-13}}{5 \times 10^{-11}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01
\]

So:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1
\]

### Step 4: Compute BER using Q-function

\[
P_b = Q(0.1)
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using approximation:

\[
Q(0.1) \approx 0.4602
\]

(You can use a calculator or software like MATLAB with `qfunc(0.1)` which gives ≈ 0.4602.)

A PM signal is s(t)=5 cos(2π·2 MHz·t + 3 cos(2π·5 kHz·t)). Find the maximum phase deviation.,"We are given a phase-modulated (PM) signal:

\[
s(t) = 5 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 2\,\text{MHz} \cdot t + 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5\,\text{kHz} \cdot t)\right)
\]

In general, a PM signal has the form:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + k_p m(t)\right)
\]

where:
- \( A_c \) is the carrier amplitude,
- \( f_c \) is the carrier frequency,
- \( k_p \) is the phase sensitivity (in radians per unit of message signal),
- \( m(t) \) is the message signal.

Comparing to the given signal:
- \( A_c = 5 \)
- \( f_c = 2\,\text{MHz} \)
- \( m(t) = \cos(2\pi \cdot 5\,\text{kHz} \cdot t) \), i.e., a sinusoidal message signal with amplitude 1
- The phase deviation term is: \( 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5\,\text{kHz} \cdot t) \)

This implies that the phase modulation index (or maximum phase deviation) is the peak value of the phase deviation function:

\[
\Delta \phi(t) = k_p m(t) = 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5\,\text{kHz} \cdot t)

DBPSK over AWGN. Find required E_b/N_0 (in dB) for BER P_b=10^{-6}.,"To find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) (in dB) for a Bit Error Rate (BER) of \( P_b = 10^{-6} \) in **DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying)** over an **AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise)** channel, we use the well-known BER expression for DBPSK.

---

### ✅ BER for DBPSK over AWGN:
The bit error rate for DBPSK is given by:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

This formula assumes coherent detection of the differential phase.

---

### 🔍 Given:
- Desired BER: \( P_b = 10^{-6} \)

Set up the equation:

\[
10^{-6} = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-6} = \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = -\frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

Calculate the left-hand side:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-6}) = \ln(2) - 6 \ln(10)
\]

Use approximations:
- \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 0.6931 - 6 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 13.8156 = -13.1225
\]

Therefore:

\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = -13.1225 \Rightarrow \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 13.1225
\]

Convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(13.1225) \approx 11.18 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### Step 1: Plug in the value

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2 \times 20}\right) = Q\left(\sqrt{40}\right)
\]

\[
\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10} \approx 2 \times 3.1623 = 6.3246
\]

So,

\[
P_b = Q(6.3246)
\]

---

### Step 2: Estimate the Q-function value

The Q-function is defined as:

\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

For large \( x \), we can use the approximation:

\[
Q(x) \approx \frac{1}{x\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}
\]

Let’s compute it for \( x = 6.3246 \):

- \( x^2 = 40 \)
- \( x^2/2 = 20 \)
- \( e^{-20} \approx 2.061 \times 10^{-9} \)
- \( \frac{1}{x\sqrt{2\pi}} = \frac{1}{6.3246 \times \sqrt{2\pi}} \approx \frac{1}{6.3246 \times 2.5066} \approx \frac{1}{15.85} \approx 0.0631 \)

Now multiply:

\[
Q(6.3246) \approx 0.0631 \times 2.061 \times 10^{-9} \approx 1.299 \times 10^{-10}

"Shannon capacity. B=50 MHz, SNR=0.1 (linear). Compute C (Mbps).","To compute the **Shannon capacity** \( C \) of a communication channel, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}) \quad \text{(in bits per second)}
\]

Where:
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB),
- \( C \) is the channel capacity in bits per second.

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 50 \, \text{MHz} = 50 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 0.1 (linear)

---

### Step-by-step Calculation:

\[
C = 50 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 0.1) = 50 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1.1)

Chip rate is 2 Mcps and m-sequence period is 31 chips. Find period time.,"To find the **period time** of an m-sequence given:

- Chip rate = 2 Mcps (mega chips per second) = 2 × 10⁶ chips/second  
- M-sequence period = 31 chips

---

### Step 1: Understand what ""period time"" means
The **period time** is the time it takes to transmit one full period of the sequence — i.e., the duration of 31 chips.

---

### Step 2: Calculate time per chip
Since the chip rate is 2 × 10⁶ chips per second:

\[
\text{Time per chip} = \frac{1}{\text{chip rate}} = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^6} = 0.5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ seconds} = 0.5 \, \mu\text{s}

- Symbol rate of the TDM link:  
  \( R_s = 9.6 \times 10^6 \) baud (bits per second, since 1 bit/symbol)
- Each analog channel has bandwidth:  
  \( f_H = 3 \) kHz
- PCM encoding uses:  
  \( n = 8 \) bits/sample
- Sampling at Nyquist rate → sampling frequency \( f_s = 2f_H = 2 \times 3\,\text{kHz} = 6\,\text{kHz} \)

---

### Step 1: Calculate bits per second per channel

Nyquist sampling gives:
- Samples per second = \( f_s = 6000 \) samples/sec
- Each sample = 8 bits

So, bits per second per channel:
\[
R_{\text{channel}} = f_s \times n = 6000 \times 8 = 48,000 \text{ bps}
\]

---

### Step 2: Total number of channels l that can be multiplexed

Total available bit rate from the TDM link:
\[
R_s = 9.6 \times 10^6 \text{ bps}
\]

Each channel requires 48,000 bps.

So,
\[
l = \frac{R_s}{R_{\text{channel}}} = \frac{9.6 \times 10^6}{48,000}

Log-normal shadowing with μ= -70 dBm and σ=7 dB. Find outage probability for threshold -80 dBm.,"To find the **outage probability** for a log-normal shadowing model, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normal distribution.

---

### Given:
- Mean of received power in dBm:  
  **μ = -70 dBm**
- Standard deviation of shadowing in dB:  
  **σ = 7 dB**
- Threshold power for outage:  
  **P_th = -80 dBm**

Outage occurs when the received power **falls below** the threshold:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(P_{\text{rx}} < P_{\text{th}})
\]

Since the received power \( P_{\text{rx}} \) is log-normally distributed in dBm, its logarithm (in linear scale) is normally distributed. But since we're already working in dBm, we can directly use the normal CDF.

First, convert the problem to standard normal form:

\[
z = \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{-80 - (-70)}{7} = \frac{-10}{7} \approx -1.4286
\]

Now compute the outage probability using the standard normal CDF \( \Phi(z) \):

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi(-1.4286)

From standard normal tables or using a calculator:

\[
\Phi(-1.4286) \approx 1 - \Phi(1.4286) \approx 1 - 0.9236 = 0.0764

So,
\[
A_0^2 = -(-2.9957) = 2.9957

- Power of User 2: \( P_2 = 5 \, \text{mW} \)
- Noise power: \( N = 1 \, \text{mW} \)

Plug in the values:

\[
C_1 = 20 \times 10^6 \cdot \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{10}{5 + 1}\right)

"Matched filter output peak time. For p(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T)] passed through its matched filter, at what time does the output reach maximum?","For a pulse signal \( p(t) = A [U(t) - U(t - T)] \), which is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \) and duration \( T \), the **matched filter** is designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the output.

### Key Concept:
The matched filter for a signal \( p(t) \) has an impulse response:
\[
h(t) = p^*(T_0 - t)
\]
where \( T_0 \) is typically chosen as the time at which the filter is evaluated — often the end of the signal duration, i.e., \( T_0 = T \) for causal signals.

For this rectangular pulse:

- \( p(t) = A \) for \( 0 \leq t < T \)
- Zero otherwise

So the matched filter impulse response is:
\[
h(t) = p^*(T - t) = 
\begin{cases}
A & \text{if } 0 \leq T - t < T \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\Rightarrow
h(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A & \text{if } 0 < t \leq T \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

This means the matched filter is also a rectangular pulse of duration \( T \), flipped in time and shifted to start at \( t = 0 \) and end at \( t = T \).

Now, the output \( y(t) \) of the matched filter is the convolution:
\[
y(t) = p(t) * h(t)
\]

Convolution of two identical rectangular pulses of width \( T \) results in a triangular pulse that peaks at \( t = T \).

### ✅ Final Answer:
The output reaches its maximum at:
\[
\boxed{T}

This is the time when the entire pulse aligns with the reversed and delayed version of itself in the matched filter.",t = T,0.8,0.057112150000000014

- Number of bits in the sync pattern: \( n = 22 \)
- Channel bit error rate (BER): \( p = 10^{-4} = 0.0001 \)
- No errors allowed in the sync pattern, i.e., \( m = 0 \)

The miss probability is the probability that **at least one bit in the sync pattern is in error**, which means the sync pattern is not correctly received — hence ""missed"".

This is approximated by:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx 1 - (1 - p)^n

### Step-by-step calculation:

1. Compute \( (1 - p)^n \):
   \[
   (1 - p)^n = (1 - 10^{-4})^{22} = (0.9999)^{22}

   \]
   \[
   (1 - p)^n \approx e^{-0.0022}

- Standard deviation of log-normal fading \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)

We assume the received signal power follows a **log-normal distribution**. The outage occurs when the received power drops below the threshold \( P_{\text{th}} \).

---

### Step 1: Use the Q-function
The outage probability is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = Q\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( \mu \) is the **mean received power (in dBm)** — this is what we want to find
- \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)
- \( P_{\text{th}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- \( Q(x) \) is the standard normal tail probability function

We solve for \( \mu \) such that:

\[
Q\left( \frac{15 - \mu}{4} \right) = 0.005
\]

---

### Step 2: Find the inverse Q-function value

We need the value \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 0.005 \).  
From standard normal tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q(x) = 0.005 \Rightarrow x \approx 2.576
\]

(Since \( Q(2.576) \approx 0.005 \))

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \mu \)

Set up the equation:

\[
\frac{15 - \mu}{4} = 2.576

Multiply both sides by 4:

Gray-coded QPSK required E_b/N_0. Target BER P_b=2×10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 in dB (use Q^{-1}(2e-6)≈4.61).,"To find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB for Gray-coded QPSK with a target bit error rate (BER) \( P_b = 2 \times 10^{-6} \), we use the standard BER formula for Gray-coded QPSK:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

We are given:
- Target \( P_b = 2 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q^{-1}(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 4.61 \)

### Step-by-step solution:

1. Start from the BER equation:
   \[
   Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 2 \times 10^{-6}
   \]

2. Take the inverse Q-function of both sides:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 4.61
   \]

3. Square both sides:
   \[
   \frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.61)^2 = 21.2521
   \]

4. Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \):
   \[
   \frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{21.2521}{2} = 10.626
   \]

5. Convert to dB:
   \[
   \frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(10.626) \approx 10.26 \, \text{dB}

with parameters:
- \( A_c = 4 \, \text{V} \)
- \( \mu = 0.6 \)

We are to find the **magnitudes of the impulses in the spectrum \( S(f) \)** at:
- \( \pm f_c \)
- \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Use trigonometric identity
Expand the product using the identity for cosine multiplication:

\[
\cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \right]
\]

So,
\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

Substitute the identity:
\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \right]
\]

---

### Step 2: Take Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform of \( \cos(2\pi f_0 t) \) is:
\[
\mathcal{F}\{\cos(2\pi f_0 t)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0) \right]
\]

Apply this to each term:

1. For \( A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) \):
   \[
   \frac{A_c}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c) \right]
   \]

2. For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) \):
   \[
   \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m)) \right]

3. For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \):
   \[
   \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c - f_m)) \right]

### Step 3: Combine all terms

Total spectrum \( S(f) \):

\[
S(f) = \frac{A_c}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c) \right] 
+ \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m)) \right]
+ \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c - f_m)) \right]
\]

---

### Step 4: Plug in values

Given:
- \( A_c = 4 \)
- \( \mu = 0.6 \)

Compute magnitudes:

- At \( \pm f_c \):  
  Magnitude = \( \frac{A_c}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{V} \)

- At \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \):  
  Magnitude = \( \frac{A_c \mu}{4} = \frac{4 \times 0.6}{4} = \frac{2.4}{4} = 0.6 \, \text{V} \)

Matched filter output time for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-3T/4)]. Matched filter uses h(t)=s(T-t). At what time does output peak?,"We are given:

- Pulse signal:  
  \( s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{3T}{4}\right) \right] \)  
  This is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \), and ending at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).

- Matched filter impulse response:  
  \( h(t) = s(T - t) \)

We are to find the time at which the matched filter output peaks.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Matched Filter Output
The output of a matched filter is the convolution:
\[
y(t) = s(t) * h(t) = s(t) * s(T - t)
\]

A key property of matched filters is that the peak occurs **at the end of the signal**, i.e., at \( t = T \), provided the signal starts at \( t = 0 \) and ends at \( t = T \). But here, our signal ends at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \), not at \( T \).

So we must compute the convolution carefully or use the known result:

> For a signal \( s(t) \) of duration \( \tau \), the matched filter output peaks at \( t = \tau \), where \( \tau \) is the time at which the signal ends.

In this case:
- Signal \( s(t) \) is nonzero from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).
- So the matched filter output \( y(t) = s(t) * h(t) \) will peak at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).

But wait — there's an important nuance. The matched filter is designed for a signal of duration \( T \), but in this problem, it’s applied to a pulse that ends at \( \frac{3T}{4} \), not at \( T \). Let’s verify this using the general rule.

---

### General Rule (Key Insight):
For a signal \( s(t) \) with support on \([0, \tau]\), the matched filter output \( y(t) = s(t) * s(\tau - t) \) peaks at \( t = \tau \). The peak time is always the end time of the signal, regardless of the value of \( T \) used in defining \( h(t) \), as long as \( h(t) = s(T - t) \) and we interpret \( T \) as the total time over which the filter is built.

However, note that in the definition:
\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]
This means the matched filter is ""tuned"" to the signal \( s(t) \), but the reference time \( T \) is arbitrary — it’s just part of the formula.

Actually, the correct interpretation is:

The matched filter output peaks when the entire signal has been ""correlated"" with itself. That happens when the flipped and delayed version of the signal aligns fully with the original — i.e., at \( t = \text{duration of } s(t) \).

Since \( s(t) \) is nonzero only from \( 0 \) to \( \frac{3T}{4} \), the convolution will reach its maximum at:
\[
t = \frac{3T}{4}
\]

✅ This is the standard result: the matched filter output peaks at the end of the input signal.

---

### Final Answer:

Rayleigh clipping model exp(-A0^2). Find A0 for clipping probability 0.5%.,"To find \( A_0 \) for a **Rayleigh clipping model** with a clipping probability of **0.5%**, we start from the given expression:

\[
P_{\text{clipping}} = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

This model assumes that the probability of clipping (i.e., signal amplitude exceeding a threshold) is modeled by an exponential decay in terms of \( A_0^2 \), where \( A_0 \) is the threshold normalized to the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the signal.

We are given:
\[
P_{\text{clipping}} = 0.005 \quad \text{(since 0.5% = 0.005)}
\]

So, set up the equation:
\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.005
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.005)
\]

Solve for \( A_0^2 \):
\[
A_0^2 = -\ln(0.005)
\]

Calculate the value:
\[
\ln(0.005) \approx \ln(5 \times 10^{-3}) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^{-3}) \approx 1.6094 - 6.9078 = -5.2984
\]
So:
\[
A_0^2 \approx 5.2984
\]

Now take the square root:
\[
A_0 \approx \sqrt{5.2984} \approx 2.302
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
A_0 \approx 2.30

This means that for a Rayleigh-distributed signal, a clipping threshold at approximately **2.30 times the RMS amplitude** will result in a clipping probability of **0.5%**.",2.302,0.0,0.006597949999999999
"Compute Laplacian noise MAP threshold. Noiseless outputs are 0 or A with equal priors, noise Laplacian with parameter λ. Find threshold and P_e in terms of A and λ.","We are given a detection problem where:

- The noiseless signal is either \( 0 \) or \( A \), each with equal prior probability:  
  \( P(0) = P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)

- The observed output is corrupted by **Laplacian noise** with parameter \( \lambda \):  
  The noise PDF is:
  \[
  p_n(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|n|}{\lambda}}
  \]

- So the observed signal \( y \) is:
  \[
  y = 
  \begin{cases}
  n & \text{if } x=0 \\
  A + n & \text{if } x=A
  \end{cases}
  \]

We are to find the **MAP (Maximum A Posteriori)** decision rule, which includes:
1. The **threshold** for deciding between 0 and A.
2. The resulting **probability of error** \( P_e \) in terms of \( A \) and \( \lambda \).

---

### Step 1: Write Likelihoods

The likelihoods of observing \( y \) under each hypothesis:

- If \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  p(y|0) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|y|}{\lambda}}
  \]

- If \( x = A \):
  \[
  p(y|A) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|y - A|}{\lambda}}
  \]

Since priors are equal, MAP reduces to **Maximum Likelihood (ML)**. So we compare:
\[
p(y|0) \quad \text{vs.} \quad p(y|A)
\]

Take log-ratio:
\[
\log \frac{p(y|A)}{p(y|0)} = \log \left( \frac{e^{-\frac{|y - A|}{\lambda}}}{e^{-\frac{|y|}{\lambda}}} \right) = \frac{1}{\lambda} \left( |y| - |y - A| \right)
\]

So, decide \( x = A \) if:
\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} \left( |y| - |y - A| \right) > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |y| > |y - A|
\]

This inequality determines the threshold.

---

### Step 2: Find Threshold

We need to solve:
\[
|y| > |y - A|
\]

This depends on the sign of \( y \). Let's consider cases based on the value of \( y \):

#### Case 1: \( y \geq A > 0 \)

Then:
- \( |y| = y \), \( |y - A| = y - A \)
- Inequality: \( y > y - A \Rightarrow 0 > -A \Rightarrow A > 0 \) → Always true.

So for \( y \geq A \), decide \( A \).

#### Case 2: \( 0 \leq y < A \)

Then:
- \( |y| = y \), \( |y - A| = A - y \)
- Inequality: \( y > A - y \Rightarrow 2y > A \Rightarrow y > \frac{A}{2} \)

So for \( \frac{A}{2} < y < A \), decide \( A \); else decide 0.

#### Case 3: \( y < 0 \)

Then:
- \( |y| = -y \), \( |y - A| = A - y \) (since \( y < 0 < A \))
- Inequality: \( -y > A - y \Rightarrow 0 > A \) — false since \( A > 0 \)

So for \( y < 0 \), decide 0.

Therefore, the optimal threshold is at:
\[
T = \frac{A}{2}
\]

Decision rule:
- Decide \( A \) if \( y > \frac{A}{2} \)
- Decide \( 0 \) if \( y < \frac{A}{2} \)

(Since it's continuous, boundary has measure zero.)

✅ **Threshold = \( \frac{A}{2} \)**

---

### Step 3: Compute Probability of Error \( P_e \)

By symmetry of the setup (equal priors, symmetric Laplacian), and knowing that the decision boundary is at \( \frac{A}{2} \), we can compute:

\[
P_e = \frac{1}{2} P(\text{decide } A \mid x=0) + \frac{1}{2} P(\text{decide } 0 \mid x=A)
\]

Let’s compute each term.

#### 1. \( P(\text{decide } A \mid x=0) = P(y > \frac{A}{2} \mid x=0) \)

When \( x = 0 \), \( y = n \sim \text{Laplace}(0, \lambda) \), so:
\[
P\left( n > \frac{A}{2} \right) = \int_{A/2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{n}{\lambda}} dn
\]
(since \( n > 0 \))

Compute:
\[
= \frac{1}{2\lambda} \cdot \left[ -\lambda e^{-\frac{n}{\lambda}} \right]_{A/2}^{\infty}
= \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{A}{2\lambda}}
\]

#### 2. \( P(\text{decide } 0 \mid x=A) = P(y < \frac{A}{2} \mid x=A) \)

When \( x = A \), \( y = A + n \), so:
\[
P\left( A + n < \frac{A}{2} \right) = P\left( n < -\frac{A}{2} \right)
= \int_{-\infty}^{-A/2} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|n|}{\lambda}} dn
\]

Split into two parts: from \(-\infty\) to 0, then 0 to \(-A/2\), but better to use the CDF of Laplace:

For \( n < 0 \), \( |n| = -n \), so:
\[
P(n < -A/2) = \int_{-\infty}^{-A/2} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{\frac{n}{\lambda}} dn
\quad \text{(since } |n| = -n \text{ when } n<0)
\]

Let \( u = \frac{n}{\lambda} \Rightarrow du = \frac{dn}{\lambda} \), limits: \( u \to -\infty \) to \( -\frac{A}{2\lambda} \)

\[
= \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{-A/(2\lambda)} e^{u} du
= \frac{1}{2} \left[ e^{u} \right]_{-\infty}^{-A/(2\lambda)}
= \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{A}{2\lambda}}
\]

So both terms are equal!

Thus:
\[
P_e = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{A}{2\lambda}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{A}{2\lambda}} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\frac{A}{2\lambda}}
\]

The formula for the capacity of user 1 when decoded first is:

\[

Log-normal shadowing with σ=8 dB. Required threshold is 10 dBm. Find mean μ needed for outage 5%.,"To find the mean μ (in dBm) for a log-normal shadowing model such that the outage probability is 5%, given:

- Standard deviation σ = 8 dB  
- Required threshold P_th = 10 dBm  
- Outage probability P_out = 5% = 0.05  

---

### Step 1: Understand the Log-Normal Model
The received power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where:
- \( \mu \): mean of the underlying normal distribution (in dBm)
- \( \sigma = 8 \) dB

Outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{th} \), i.e., when the received power falls below the threshold.

The outage probability is:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < P_{th}) = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{th} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

---

### Step 2: Solve for μ
We are given \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.05 \), so:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{8} \right) = 0.05
\]

Find the z-value such that \( \Phi(z) = 0.05 \).  
From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF:

---

### Formula:
For a raised cosine filter in binary signaling, the relationship between bandwidth \( B \), roll-off factor \( \alpha \), and symbol rate \( R_s \) is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)

Compute coherent OOK threshold for equal priors when A=0.2 V.,"To compute the coherent OOK (On-Off Keying) detection threshold for equal priors when the signal amplitude \( A = 0.2 \, \text{V} \), we follow the standard derivation for optimal detection in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

---

### **Assumptions:**
- Coherent detection
- Equal prior probabilities: \( P(s_0) = P(s_1) = 0.5 \)
- Signal model:
  - \( s_0(t) = 0 \) (no signal)
  - \( s_1(t) = A \cdot p(t) \) (signal present, where \( p(t) \) is a pulse shape with energy \( E_b = \int |p(t)|^2 dt \))
- AWGN with power spectral density \( N_0/2 \)
- Optimal receiver uses matched filter output at sampling time

---

### **Receiver Output:**
At the matched filter output, for each symbol duration, the received signal is:

- If \( s_0 \): \( r = n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \)
- If \( s_1 \): \( r = A\sqrt{E_b} + n \sim \mathcal{N}(A\sqrt{E_b}, \sigma^2) \)

Here, \( \sigma^2 = \frac{N_0}{2} \cdot T_b \). But since \( A \) is given as a voltage, and assuming \( p(t) \) has unit energy (i.e., \( E_b = 1 \)), then the signal at the matched filter output is just \( A \) volts when the signal is present.

So, equivalently:
- \( s_0 \): \( r \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{N_0}{2}) \)
- \( s_1 \): \( r \sim \mathcal{N}(A, \frac{N_0}{2}) \)

---

### **Optimal Threshold (for equal priors):**
When priors are equal, the optimal threshold \( \gamma \) is the midpoint between the two means:

\[
\gamma = \frac{0 + A}{2} = \frac{A}{2}
\]

This minimizes the probability of error under equal priors.

"Compute miss probability for sync word allowing up to 1 error (m=1). Sync length n=40, channel BER p=10^{-5}. Approximate P_miss≈C(n,2)p^2.","We are asked to compute the **miss probability** for a synchronization word of length \( n = 40 \), allowing up to 1 error (\( m = 1 \)), with a channel bit error rate (BER) \( p = 10^{-5} \).

The problem suggests using the approximation:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

This approximation is used when we're interested in the probability that at least one incorrect match occurs due to **at most 2 errors** — specifically, when two bits differ between the received sequence and a wrong sync word. This is because if two bits are flipped in a 40-bit sync word, it could accidentally match another valid sync word (if the number of differing positions is ≤ 1). But more precisely, this formula approximates the probability that a random incorrect pattern (i.e., not the true sync word) matches the received signal within tolerance \( m=1 \), which includes cases where up to 1 bit differs.

Actually, the standard derivation for the miss probability in sync detection considers the chance that an incorrect sync word (a ""spurious"" match) differs from the true sync word in at most \( m = 1 \) positions — which would cause false synchronization.

But here, the hint tells us to use:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

Let’s interpret what this means. The term \( \binom{n}{2} \) counts the number of ways to choose 2 bit positions out of \( n \) to flip — assuming that only 2 errors occur (i.e., 2 bits are corrupted), which might mimic a different sync word that matches the receiver's criteria (say, Hamming distance ≤ 1).

However, for small \( p \), the dominant contribution to the miss probability comes from the case where exactly 2 bits are in error — since the probability of 1 or 0 errors is negligible compared to 2 errors in this context (though actually, 1 error should be considered too!).

Wait — let's clarify: if you allow up to 1 error in sync detection, then a candidate sync word is accepted if it differs in at most 1 bit from the received word.

So the miss probability is the probability that an incorrect sync word (not the correct one) matches the received word within Hamming distance 1 — i.e., differs by 0 or 1 bit.

A better approach is to consider the probability that a **random** (incorrect) sync word agrees with the received word in at least \( n - 1 \) positions — i.e., differs in at most 1 bit.

For each incorrect sync word, the probability that it agrees with the received word in all but at most one bit is approximately:
- Probability that 0 bits differ: \( (1 - p)^n \approx 1 \) for small \( p \)
- Probability that exactly 1 bit differs: \( n p (1 - p)^{n-1} \approx n p \)

But this gives the probability that a single incorrect sync word is mistaken as correct — and then multiplied by the number of possible incorrect sync words.

However, the given approximation:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

is a simplification based on the idea that the majority of false matches occur when **exactly 2 bits are in error** — because if two bits are flipped, they can produce a pattern that looks like a different sync word that is also within distance 1 of the received word.

In fact, for large \( n \), small \( p \), and moderate errors, the leading-order term of the miss probability (from Poisson-type approximations) is often dominated by the probability of having exactly 2 bit errors across the entire sync word — which could make a wrong sync word match the received one.

Hence, the expression \( \binom{n}{2} p^2 \) represents the expected number of pairs of bit positions where both are in error — and if these two bits are flipped, they may result in a false sync detection.

So, plugging in the numbers:

- \( n = 40 \)
- \( p = 10^{-5} \)

Compute:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{40}{2} \cdot (10^{-5})^2
\]

First, calculate \( \binom{40}{2} \):

\[
\binom{40}{2} = \frac{40 \times 39}{2} = 780
\]

Then:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx 780 \times (10^{-10}) = 7.8 \times 10^{-8}

\[

- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale

Given:
- SNR (dB) = 20 dB

Use the formula:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into Shannon-Hartley formula

Bandwidth \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3400 \, \text{Hz} \)

\[
C = 3400 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 3400 \times \log_2(101)
\]

We need to calculate \( \log_2(101) \). Use the change of base formula:

\[
\log_2(101) = \frac{\log_{10}(101)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{2.0043}{0.3010} \approx 6.658

Union-bound term threshold for QPSK. Want Q(\sqrt{4E_b/N_0})<10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 (dB).,"We are given a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) system and want to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB such that the bit error rate (BER) is less than \( 10^{-6} \).

For QPSK, the BER in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Wait — note: there's a common confusion here. Let’s clarify.

In **QPSK**, each symbol carries **2 bits**. The energy per symbol \( E_s = 2E_b \), so when we write the BER formula for QPSK, it's:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

But sometimes people use \( E_s/N_0 \). To avoid confusion, let’s stick with the standard QPSK BER expression:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

We are told:

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) < 10^{-6}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \), so we need:

\[
Q(x) < 10^{-6}
\]

Now, find \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \).

From standard Q-function tables or using inverse Q-function:

\[
Q(x) = 10^{-6} \Rightarrow x \approx 4.753
\]

(You can verify this using:
- MATLAB: `x = qfuncinv(1e-6)`
- Python: `from scipy.special import erfcinv; x = sqrt(2)*erfcinv(2*1e-6)`
- Or use approximation formulas.)

So,

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.753
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.753)^2 \approx 22.59
\]

Then,

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{22.59}{2} = 11.295

Convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(11.295) \approx 10.53 \, \text{dB}

"Uniform quantizer: given step Δ=0.1 V, compute number of bits needed if full-scale range is -6.3 V to +6.3 V and endpoints included.","To compute the number of bits needed for a uniform quantizer, we follow these steps:

---

### **Given:**
- Step size (Δ) = 0.1 V  
- Full-scale range = from -6.3 V to +6.3 V  
- Endpoints are included → This means the full range includes both -6.3 and +6.3 V.

---

### **Step 2: Determine number of quantization levels**
Each step is Δ = 0.1 V, so the number of intervals (levels) is:
\[
L = \frac{\text{Total range}}{\Delta} = \frac{12.6}{0.1} = 126
\]

Wait — this would imply 126 intervals, but that would correspond to **127 levels** if endpoints are included!

Hold on — let’s clarify:

When endpoints are **included** and you have a uniform step size, the number of distinct levels is:
\[
L = \frac{\text{Total range}}{\Delta} + 1
\]
Why? Because with step Δ, from a starting point at -6.3 V, the next level is at -6.3 + 0.1, then -6.3 + 2×0.1, ..., up to +6.3 V.

So:
\[
L = \frac{12.6}{0.1} + 1 = 126 + 1 = 127 \text{ levels}

Convert received power 6.88×10^{-13} W to dBm.,"To convert power from watts (W) to decibels relative to one milliwatt (dBm), use the formula:

\[
P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_{\text{W}}}{1 \, \text{mW}}\right)
\]

Given:
- \( P_{\text{W}} = 6.88 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{W} \)
- \( 1 \, \text{mW} = 10^{-3} \, \text{W} \)

So,

\[
P_{\text{dBm}} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{6.88 \times 10^{-13}}{10^{-3}}\right)
= 10 \log_{10}(6.88 \times 10^{-10})

### Given:
- Audio signal frequency: \( f_H = 7 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Sampling is done at the **Nyquist rate**
- Quantization: 12 bits per sample

---

### Step 1: Nyquist Sampling Rate
The Nyquist rate is:
\[
f_s = 2 \times f_H = 2 \times 7 \, \text{kHz} = 14 \, \text{kHz}

"Compute PM bandwidth. For φ_max=2 rad and f_m=10 kHz, use Δf=φ_max f_m. Find B.","To compute the PM (Phase Modulation) bandwidth, we use Carson's rule for phase modulation.

Given:

- f_m = 10 kHz (modulating frequency)

The frequency deviation Δf for phase modulation is given by:

\[

"Minimum mean power for 1% outage. Threshold 10 dBm, σ=12 dB. Find μ.","To find the minimum mean power (μ) for a 1% outage probability, given:

- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 12 \, \text{dB} \)
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 1\% = 0.01 \)

This is a classic problem in wireless communications involving log-normal shadowing.

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

Assume the received power \( P_r \) follows a **log-normal distribution**:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
In dB terms:
\[
\text{dB}(P_r) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\text{dB}}, \sigma^2)
\]

We want:
\[
P(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = 0.01
\]

Convert to standard normal:
\[
P\left( \frac{\text{dB}(P_r) - \mu_{\text{dB}}}{\sigma} < \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu_{\text{dB}}}{\sigma} \right) = 0.01
\]

Let \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1) \). Then:
\[
P\left( Z < \frac{10 - \mu}{12} \right) = 0.01
\]

Find the z-score corresponding to cumulative probability 0.01:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{12} \right) = 0.01
\Rightarrow \frac{10 - \mu}{12} = z_{0.01}
\]

From standard normal tables:
\[
z_{0.01} \approx -2.326
\]

Now solve for \( \mu \):
\[
\frac{10 - \mu}{12} = -2.326 \\
10 - \mu = -27.912 \\
\mu = 10 + 27.912 = 37.912 \, \text{dBm}

- \( K = 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \)
- \( \gamma = 4 \)
- \( d_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \)
- \( d = 100 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 1: Plug in the values

\[
P_r = 0.01 \cdot (5.70 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^4
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^4 \)

\[
\left(\frac{1}{100}\right)^4 = 10^{-8}
\]

### Step 3: Multiply all terms

\[
P_r = 0.01 \cdot 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 10^{-8}
\]

First, multiply the constants:
\[
0.01 = 10^{-2}
\]
So:
\[
P_r = 10^{-2} \cdot 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 10^{-8}
= 5.70 \times 10^{-2 - 4 - 8}
= 5.70 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{W}

"Gray-coded QPSK over AWGN. For BER P_b=3×10^{-5}, find E_b/N_0 in dB (use Q^{-1}).","To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) in dB for Gray-coded QPSK with a bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 3 \times 10^{-5} \), we proceed as follows:

---

### Step 1: BER expression for Gray-coded QPSK over AWGN

For Gray-coded QPSK, the bit error rate is given by:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

This is because in Gray coding, each symbol error results in only **one bit error** on average, so the BER equals the symbol error rate for QPSK under this mapping.

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Given:
\[
P_b = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Set:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Take the inverse Q-function on both sides:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5})
\]

Now compute \( Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5}) \).

From standard Q-function tables or using approximations:

- \( Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.265 \)

(This value comes from the known relation that \( Q(4.265) \approx 3 \times 10^{-5} \))

So:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.265
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.265)^2 = 18.19
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{18.19}{2} = 9.095
\]

Convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(9.095) \approx 9.59 \, \text{dB}

Specify the ideal BPF magnitude response passband.,"For a Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC) signal using the **Upper Sideband (USB)**, the message bandwidth is 6 kHz. This means the modulated signal contains frequency components from:

- The carrier frequency \( f_c = 120 \) kHz  
- Up to \( f_c + 6 \) kHz = 126 kHz  

Since it's USB-SSB, only the upper sideband is transmitted — that is, frequencies from 120 kHz to 126 kHz.

"A baseband system must transmit R_b=4000 bit/s through a telephone channel with B_avail=3100 Hz. Using raised-cosine shaping, what maximum roll-off α is allowable for QPSK?","To determine the maximum allowable roll-off factor α for a QPSK system in a baseband channel, we use the relationship between the bit rate \( R_b \), the channel bandwidth \( B_{\text{avail}} \), and the roll-off factor \( \alpha \).

For **QPSK**, each symbol carries 2 bits. Therefore, the symbol rate \( R_s \) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{R_b}{2} = \frac{4000}{2} = 2000 \text{ symbols/second}
\]

For a raised-cosine filter, the required bandwidth \( B \) is given by:

\[
B = R_s (1 + \alpha)

We are told that the available bandwidth is \( B_{\text{avail}} = 3100 \) Hz. To find the maximum allowable roll-off factor \( \alpha \), set the required bandwidth equal to the available bandwidth:

Substitute known values:

\[

- The measured DC component is 1 V.
- \( m(t) \) is zero-mean, i.e., \( \mathbb{E}[m(t)] = 0 \).

### Step 1: Understand the DC component
The DC component of a signal is its average value over time. For \( S_{\text{LPF}}(t) \), we compute the expected value:

\[
\mathbb{E}[S_{\text{LPF}}(t)] = \frac{A}{2} \cdot \mathbb{E}[m(t) + 1] = \frac{A}{2} \left( \mathbb{E}[m(t)] + 1 \right)

- **Carrier frequency** \( f_c = 250 \) kHz

The DSB-SC signal occupies two sidebands:
- Lower Sideband (LSB): from \( f_c - B \) to \( f_c \)

For a two-tone test, the relationship between the output IM3 level and IIP3 is approximately:

\[
\text{IM3}_{\text{out}} = 3 \cdot \text{P}_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}
\]

Alternatively, using the ""3rd-order intercept point"" concept:

The difference between the fundamental and IM3 outputs (Δ) is related to IIP3 by:

\[
\Delta = 3 \cdot (\text{IIP3} - \text{P}_{\text{in}})
\]

Where:
- Δ = 30 dB
- Pin = −6 dBm (input power per tone)

Plug in:

\[
30 = 3 \cdot (\text{IIP3} - (-6)) \\
30 = 3 \cdot (\text{IIP3} + 6)
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
10 = \text{IIP3} + 6
\]

Solve:

\[
\text{IIP3} = 10 - 6 = 4 \, \text{dBm}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**IIP3 ≈ 4 dBm**

This means that if the input were increased to 4 dBm (per tone), the fundamental and IM3 would theoretically intersect, indicating where distortion becomes severe.",9.0,0.0,0.06773974999999997
Convert noise -174 dBm/Hz to W/Hz.,"To convert from dBm/Hz to W/Hz, use the following relationship:

\[
P_{\text{W/Hz}} = 10^{\frac{P_{\text{dBm/Hz}} - 30}{10}}
\]

Where:
- \( P_{\text{dBm/Hz}} = -174 \) dBm/Hz
- The subtraction of 30 accounts for converting from milliwatts (mW) to watts (W), since 0 dBm = 1 mW = \(10^{-3}\) W.

Now plug in the value:

\[
P_{\text{W/Hz}} = 10^{\frac{-174 - 30}{10}} = 10^{\frac{-204}{10}} = 10^{-20.4}
\]

So,

Laplacian noise detector: noiseless outputs 0 or A with equal priors and noise pdf f(n)=(1/(2λ))exp(-|n|/λ). Find optimal threshold V_d.,"We are given a Laplacian noise model and asked to find the optimal detection threshold \( V_d \) for distinguishing between two hypotheses:

- \( H_0 \): Noiseless output is 0  
- \( H_1 \): Noiseless output is \( A \)

The noise \( n \) has a Laplacian PDF:
\[
f(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} \exp\left(-\frac{|n|}{\lambda}\right)
\]

The received signal \( y \) is:
- Under \( H_0 \): \( y = 0 + n \)
- Under \( H_1 \): \( y = A + n \)

We assume equal priors: \( P(H_0) = P(H_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)

---

### Goal:
Find the **optimal threshold** \( V_d \) that minimizes the probability of error (i.e., minimize \( P_e \)).

This corresponds to the **maximum a posteriori (MAP)** decision rule, which for equal priors reduces to the **maximum likelihood (ML)** decision rule.

---

### Step 1: Compute Likelihood Ratio

The likelihood ratio (LR) is:
\[
\Lambda(y) = \frac{f(y | H_1)}{f(y | H_0)}
= \frac{f(y - A)}{f(y)}
\]

Substitute the Laplacian PDF:
\[
\Lambda(y) = \frac{\frac{1}{2\lambda} \exp\left(-\frac{|y - A|}{\lambda}\right)}{\frac{1}{2\lambda} \exp\left(-\frac{|y|}{\lambda}\right)}
= \exp\left( \frac{|y| - |y - A|}{\lambda} \right)
\]

---

### Step 2: MAP Decision Rule

Under equal priors, decide \( H_1 \) if \( \Lambda(y) > 1 \), i.e., if:
\[
\frac{|y| - |y - A|}{\lambda} > 0
\Rightarrow |y| > |y - A|
\]

So the decision rule is:
- Choose \( H_1 \) if \( |y| > |y - A| \)
- Choose \( H_0 \) otherwise

This inequality defines the boundary where the decision flips — this is where we set our threshold \( V_d \).

---

### Step 3: Solve \( |y| = |y - A| \)

This equation determines the optimal threshold. We solve:
\[
|y| = |y - A|
\]

This equality occurs when the point \( y \) is equidistant from 0 and \( A \). The solution is:
\[
y = \frac{A}{2}
\]

Why? Geometrically, the set of points equidistant from 0 and \( A \) on the real line is exactly the midpoint: \( \frac{0 + A}{2} = \frac{A}{2} \).

Alternatively, solve algebraically:
- Case 1: \( y \geq 0 \), \( y - A \geq 0 \) → then \( y = y - A \) ⇒ contradiction.
- Case 2: \( y \geq 0 \), \( y - A < 0 \) → then \( y = -(y - A) \Rightarrow y = -y + A \Rightarrow 2y = A \Rightarrow y = \frac{A}{2} \)
- Other cases yield same result.

Thus, the optimal threshold is:
\[
V_d = \frac{A}{2}
\]

\[
\boxed{V_d = \frac{A}{2}}

A DSB-SC signal is centered at f_c=1 MHz and message bandwidth is 12 kHz. Specify positive-frequency passband.,"For a DSB-SC (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier) signal:

- The carrier frequency is \( f_c = 1 \, \text{MHz} \)
- The message bandwidth is \( B = 12 \, \text{kHz} \)

In DSB-SC modulation:
- The signal occupies two sidebands: Upper Sideband (USB) and Lower Sideband (LSB)

Compute required modulation order to fit R_b=240 kbit/s into baseband bandwidth B=120 kHz with α=0.25. Use R_b=2B log2(M)/(1+α). Find minimum power-of-2 M.,"We are given:

- Bit rate: \( R_b = 240 \) kbit/s  
- Baseband bandwidth: \( B = 120 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor: \( \alpha = 0.25 \)  
- Modulation order formula:  
  \[
  R_b = \frac{2B \log_2(M)}{1 + \alpha}
  \]

We are to **find the minimum power-of-2 value of \( M \)** such that this equation is satisfied.

---

### Step 1: Plug in known values

\[
240 \times 10^3 = \frac{2 \times 120 \times 10^3 \times \log_2(M)}{1 + 0.25}
\]

Simplify denominator:

\[
1 + 0.25 = 1.25
\]

Now plug in:

\[
240000 = \frac{240000 \times \log_2(M)}{1.25}
\]

Multiply both sides by 1.25:

\[
240000 \times 1.25 = 240000 \times \log_2(M)
\]

\[
300000 = 240000 \times \log_2(M)
\]

Divide both sides by 240000:

\[
\log_2(M) = \frac{300000}{240000} = 1.25
\]

So,

\[
M = 2^{1.25} = 2^{5/4} = \sqrt[4]{2^5} = \sqrt[4]{32}
\]

Compute numerically:

\[
2^{1.25} = 2^{1} \times 2^{0.25} = 2 \times \sqrt[4]{2} \approx 2 \times 1.1892 = 2.3784
\]

So, \( M \approx 2.3784 \)

---

### Step 2: Find minimum power-of-2 \( M \)

We need \( M \) such that \( \log_2(M) \geq 1.25 \), and \( M \) must be a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, ...).

Try small powers of 2:

- \( M = 2 \): \( \log_2(2) = 1 < 1.25 \) ❌  
- \( M = 4 \): \( \log_2(4) = 2 \geq 1.25 \) ✅  

So the smallest power-of-2 \( M \) satisfying the condition is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]

✅ This gives \( \log_2(M) = 2 \), so:

\[
R_b = \frac{2 \times 120 \text{ kHz} \times 2}{1.25} = \frac{480 \times 10^3}{1.25} = 384 \text{ kbit/s}
\]

Which exceeds 240 kbit/s — so it's sufficient.

But is there a smaller non-power-of-2? No — we must use power-of-2 as per question.

Thus, the **minimum power-of-2 M** required is:

\[

A bandpass channel has bandwidth 3000 Hz and uses binary NRZ for 2PSK. Compute spectral efficiency η.,"To compute the spectral efficiency η for a bandpass channel using binary NRZ for 2PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), we use the formula:

Give ratio in dB.","We are asked to compute the **AM synchronous detection gain factor** for a modulation index \( \mu = 0.6 \), compare it to the coherent DSB-SC gain of 2, and express the ratio in dB.

---

### Step 1: Compute AM Synchronous Detection Gain Factor  
The formula given is:

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{\mu^2}{2 + \mu^2}
\]

Plug in \( \mu = 0.6 \):

\[
\mu^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{0.36}{2 + 0.36} = \frac{0.36}{2.36} \approx 0.1525

---

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio (in linear scale)  
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{G_{AM}}{G_{DSB-SC}} = \frac{0.1525}{2} = 0.07625
\]

---

### Step 4: Convert Ratio to dB  
Use the formula:
\[
\text{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(\text{ratio}) = 10 \log_{10}(0.07625)

Calculate:
\[
\log_{10}(0.07625) \approx -1.118
\]
\[
10 \times (-1.118) = -11.18 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
- AM synchronous detection gain: \( G_{AM} \approx 0.1525 \)

This means that AM synchronous detection provides about **11.18 dB less gain** than coherent DSB-SC for this modulation index.",10.6,0.7,0.06817529999999998
A bandpass channel has bandwidth 3000 Hz and uses binary NRZ for 2PSK. Compute spectral efficiency η.,"To compute the spectral efficiency η for a bandpass channel using binary NRZ in 2PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), we follow these steps:

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth of the channel: \( B = 3000 \) Hz  
- Modulation: **2PSK** (also known as BPSK — Binary Phase Shift Keying)  
- Line coding: **NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero)** — this is a baseband representation, but since it's used in a **bandpass channel**, it implies that the binary NRZ signal is modulated onto a carrier via 2PSK.

---

### Key Concept:
Spectral efficiency \( \eta \) is defined as:

\[
\eta = \frac{R}{B}
\]

Where:
- \( R \) = bit rate (bits per second)
- \( B \) = bandwidth (Hz)

For **2PSK (BPSK)**, each symbol represents 1 bit. So, if the symbol rate is \( R_s \), then the bit rate \( R = R_s \).

---

### Bandwidth of 2PSK:
In bandpass communication, the minimum required bandwidth for 2PSK using ideal rectangular pulse shaping (which is implied by ""binary NRZ"" used directly in modulation) is approximately:

\[
B \approx R_s = R
\]

Why? Because the main lobe of the spectrum of a baseband NRZ signal has a bandwidth equal to the symbol rate, and when modulated to passband (as with 2PSK), the bandwidth is still approximately \( R_s \).

Thus, for 2PSK with NRZ pulses:
\[
R = B = 3000 \text{ bps}

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between bit rate and bandwidth for QPSK

For **QPSK**, each symbol carries 2 bits:
\[
R_s = \frac{R_b}{2} = \frac{9600}{2} = 4800 \text{ symbols per second (baud)}
\]

---

### Step 2: Bandwidth of a raised-cosine filter

The bandwidth \( B \) of a raised-cosine filtered signal is:
\[
B = R_s \cdot (1 + \alpha)
\]
where:
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor (here, \( \alpha = 1 \))

Plug in the values:
\[
B = 4800 \cdot (1 + 1) = 4800 \cdot 2 = 9600 \text{ Hz}
\]

---

### Step 3: Compare with available channel bandwidth

Available channel bandwidth = 3100 Hz  
Required bandwidth = 9600 Hz

- We're told that for a random sequence, the probability of matching a specific sync word of length \( n \) is \( P_f = 2^{-n} \)

---

### Step 1: Determine how many trials per month
A ""trial"" means a window of size \( n \) where we check for sync.

The number of possible positions in one second of data:
- Since bit rate = 200 bps, there are 200 bits/sec.
- Number of non-overlapping windows of size \( n \) per second = \( \frac{200}{n} \)
- But typically, for sync detection, overlapping windows are used — so we can assume every bit position is a candidate for starting a sync check. So total number of possible sync checks per second = 200 (one at each bit).

However, to compute **expected number of false syncs per month**, we need the total number of sync attempts in a month.

Let’s compute total bits in one month:
- Days/month = 30  
- Hours/day = 24  
- Minutes/hour = 60  
- Seconds/minute = 60  

Total seconds in a month =  
\( 30 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 30 \times 86400 = 2,592,000 \) seconds

At 200 bits/sec → Total bits in a month =  
\( 2,592,000 \times 200 = 518,400,000 \) bits

If we check for sync at every bit position, then there are approximately \( 518,400,000 \) sync attempts in a month.

But note: Each sync attempt uses a window of \( n \) bits. So if the sync word is of length \( n \), the number of **non-overlapping** windows is \( \frac{518,400,000}{n} \). However, typically, sync detectors test every bit position as a potential start (overlapping), so total number of sync checks ≈ \( 518,400,000 - n + 1 \approx 518,400,000 \) for large \( n \).

So, expected number of false syncs per month:
\[
E = (\text{total sync checks}) \times P_f = 518,400,000 \times 2^{-n}
\]

We want this expectation to be ≤ 1 (false sync at most once per month):

\[
518,400,000 \times 2^{-n} \leq 1
\]

Solve for \( n \):

\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{518,400,000}
\]

Take log base 2:

\[
-n \leq \log_2 \left( \frac{1}{518,400,000} \right ) = -\log_2(518,400,000)
\]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[
n \geq \log_2(518,400,000)
\]

Now compute \( \log_2(518,400,000) \):

First, approximate in powers of 10:

\( 518,400,000 = 5.184 \times 10^8 \)

Use change of base:

\[
\log_2(5.184 \times 10^8) = \log_2(5.184) + \log_2(10^8)
\]

- \( \log_2(5.184) \approx \log_2(5) \approx 2.32 \) (since \( 2^{2.32} \approx 5 \))  
- \( \log_2(10^8) = 8 \times \log_2(10) \approx 8 \times 3.3219 \approx 26.575 \)

So total:
\[
\log_2(518,400,000) \approx 2.32 + 26.575 = 28.895
\]

Thus:
\[
n \geq 28.895 \Rightarrow n_{\min} = 29 \quad \text{(round up)}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Minimum sync length \( n = 29 \)** bits

This ensures that the expected number of false syncs per month is at most 1.

Also, expected number of trials \( RT \) (which is the total number of sync attempts per month) is approximately:

\[
RT = 518,400,000
\]

But since it's just a quantity — not something to optimize — the main result is:

"Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ=60°. If ideal (φ=0) requires E_b/N_0=8 dB for a target BER, what additional SNR penalty (dB) is needed due to phase offset, assuming decision variable scales by cosφ?","We are given:

- Coherent BPSK with a phase offset φ = 60°
- Ideal case (φ = 0°) requires E_b/N₀ = 8 dB for a target BER
- Decision variable scales by cos(φ) due to phase offset
- Need to find the additional SNR penalty (in dB) caused by this phase offset

---

### Step 1: Understand the effect of phase offset
In coherent BPSK, the received signal is:
\[
r(t) = A \cos(2\pi f_c t + \theta) + n(t)
\]
where θ is the phase of the signal. If the receiver assumes θ = 0 but the actual phase is φ, then the decision variable (after matched filtering and sampling) becomes:
\[
d = A \cos(\phi) + n_{\text{eff}}
\]

This means that the amplitude of the signal at the decision point is reduced by a factor of \( \cos(\phi) \).

Since the signal energy is proportional to the square of the amplitude, the effective signal power is reduced by \( \cos^2(\phi) \).

Thus, the **effective SNR** becomes:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{eff}} = \text{SNR}_{\text{ideal}} \cdot \cos^2(\phi)
\]

To maintain the same BER, we must increase the input SNR to compensate for this loss.

---

### Step 2: Plug in φ = 60°
\[
\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5 \Rightarrow \cos^2(60^\circ) = 0.25
\]

So, the effective SNR is only 25% of what it would be in the ideal case — i.e., a 4× reduction in signal power.

To achieve the same BER, we need to increase the input SNR by a factor of 4 (since SNR is proportional to signal power), because:
\[
\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{new}}}{\text{SNR}_{\text{ideal}}} = \frac{1}{\cos^2(\phi)} = \frac{1}{0.25} = 4
\]

Now convert this ratio to decibels:
\[
\text{Penalty (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(4) = 6 \text{ dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**6 dB**

- Bit error probability: \( P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right) \)

### Step 1: Convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{8/10} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096
\]

### Step 2: Compute the argument of the Q-function

\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{6.3096} \approx 2.512

### Step 3: Evaluate \( Q(2.512) \)

The Q-function is defined as:
\[

  P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2S}{N}}\right)

- Signal-to-noise ratio: \( \frac{S}{N} = 20 \) (linear)

### Step 1: Plug in the value
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2 \times 20}\right) = Q\left(\sqrt{40}\right)
\]

Calculate:
\[
\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10} \approx 2 \times 3.1623 = 6.3246
\]

So,
\[
P_b = Q(6.3246)
\]

### Step 2: Estimate the Q-function value

The Q-function for large arguments can be approximated using the tail of the Gaussian distribution:

For \( x \gg 1 \),  
\[
Q(x) \approx \frac{1}{x\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2}
\]

Plug in \( x = 6.3246 \):

First, compute \( x^2 / 2 \):
\[
\frac{(6.3246)^2}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Now,
\[
Q(6.3246) \approx \frac{1}{6.3246 \cdot \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-20}
\]

Compute constants:
- \( \sqrt{2\pi} \approx 2.5066 \)
- So denominator ≈ \( 6.3246 \times 2.5066 \approx 15.85 \)
- \( e^{-20} \approx 2.06 \times 10^{-9} \)

Therefore:
\[
Q(6.3246) \approx \frac{2.06 \times 10^{-9}}{15.85} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{-10}
\]

- The BER expression for antipodal NRZ signaling:  
  \[
  P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right)
  \]

We need to find \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Use the Q-function relationship
Set the equation equal to the required BER:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 5 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \), so:
\[
Q(x) = 5 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) using the inverse Q-function or standard Q-function tables / approximations.

From standard tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q(3.29) \approx 5 \times 10^{-4}
\]

So:
\[
x = 3.29 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 3.29
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (3.29)^2 = 10.8241
\]

Then:
\[

---

### Given:
- \( P_1 = 0.9 \) → Prior probability of symbol 1 (say, +A)
- \( P_2 = 0.1 \) → Prior probability of symbol 2 (say, -A)
- \( A = 0.5 \)
- Noise power spectral density: \( N_0 = 0.2 \)

We assume additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), so the received signal is:

\[
r = s_i + n, \quad n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{N_0}{2})
\]

For 2PSK:
- Symbol 1: \( s_1 = +A \)
- Symbol 2: \( s_2 = -A \)

---

### MAP Decision Rule:
The receiver decides in favor of symbol 1 if:

\[
P(s_1 | r) > P(s_2 | r)
\]

Using Bayes' theorem and taking logs (to simplify):

\[
\log P(s_1) - \frac{(r - A)^2}{N_0} > \log P(s_2) - \frac{(r + A)^2}{N_0}
\]

Multiply both sides by \( N_0 \) (positive):

\[
N_0 \log P_1 - (r - A)^2 > N_0 \log P_2 - (r + A)^2
\]

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
N_0 (\log P_1 - \log P_2) > (r - A)^2 - (r + A)^2
\]

Expand both squares:

\[
(r - A)^2 - (r + A)^2 = (r^2 - 2Ar + A^2) - (r^2 + 2Ar + A^2) = -4Ar
\]

So:

\[
N_0 \log \left( \frac{P_1}{P_2} \right) > -4Ar
\]

Solve for \( r \):

\[
r > \frac{N_0}{4A} \log \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)
\]

This gives the **threshold \( T \)** for deciding between symbols:

\[
T = \frac{N_0}{4A} \log \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)
\]

Plug in values:

- \( N_0 = 0.2 \)
- \( A = 0.5 \)
- \( \frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{0.1}{0.9} = \frac{1}{9} \)

\[
T = \frac{0.2}{4 \times 0.5} \log \left( \frac{1}{9} \right) = \frac{0.2}{2} \cdot \log(1/9) = 0.1 \cdot (-\log 9)
\]

Compute \( \log 9 \). Using base \( e \) (natural log) unless specified otherwise:

\[
\log 9 = \ln 9 = \ln(3^2) = 2 \ln 3 \approx 2 \times 1.0986 = 2.1972

"Compute mean received power needed for outage 0.5%. Threshold 15 dBm, σ=4 dB.","To compute the **mean received power needed for a 0.5% outage probability**, given:

- Outage probability \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.5\% = 0.005 \)
- Threshold power \( P_{\text{th}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)

---

### Step 1: Understand the outage condition
In log-normal fading, the received signal power \( P_r \) is normally distributed in dB:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where:
- \( \mu \) = mean received power (in dBm) — this is what we want to find.
- \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)

Outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \), i.e., the received power falls below the threshold.

So,
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF).

We are told:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{15 - \mu}{4} \right) = 0.005
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \mu \)

Find the z-value such that \( \Phi(z) = 0.005 \).  
From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF (quantile function):

\[
z = \Phi^{-1}(0.005) \approx -2.576
\]

Now solve:
\[
\frac{15 - \mu}{4} = -2.576
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:
\[
15 - \mu = -10.304
\]

Solve for \( \mu \):
\[
\mu = 15 + 10.304 = 25.304 \, \text{dBm}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mean received power needed = 25.3 dBm**

- Required output Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): \( \text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} \)
- Noise power spectral density: \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- Message bandwidth: \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Frequency deviation: \( \Delta f = 15 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Discriminator gain: \( G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) \), where \( \beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} \)
- Receiver bandwidth: \( B_{\text{FM}} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Calculate modulation index \( \beta \)

\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} = \frac{15 \, \text{kHz}}{5 \, \text{kHz}} = 3
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute discriminator gain \( G_{\text{FM}} \)

\[
G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2 (1 + \beta) = 3 \times 3^2 \times (1 + 3) = 3 \times 9 \times 4 = 108
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute receiver bandwidth \( B_{\text{FM}} \)

\[
B_{\text{FM}} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2(15 + 5) = 2 \times 20 = 40 \, \text{kHz}
\]

---

### Step 4: Use FM SNR improvement formula

For FM systems, the output SNR is related to the input SNR by:

\[
\text{SNR}_o = \text{SNR}_i \cdot G_{\text{FM}}
\]

But we need to relate \( \text{SNR}_i \) to the input signal power \( S_i \).

The **input SNR** is:

\[
\text{SNR}_i = \frac{S_i}{N_i} = \frac{S_i}{n_0 \cdot B_{\text{FM}}}
\]

So,

\[
\text{SNR}_o = \left( \frac{S_i}{n_0 B_{\text{FM}}} \right) \cdot G_{\text{FM}}
\]

Now solve for \( S_i \):

\[
S_i = \frac{\text{SNR}_o \cdot n_0 \cdot B_{\text{FM}}}{G_{\text{FM}}}
\]

---

### Step 5: Plug in values

First, convert \( \text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} \) to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_o = 10^{30/10} = 10^3 = 1000
\]

Now:

- \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- \( B_{\text{FM}} = 40 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( G_{\text{FM}} = 108 \)

\[
S_i = \frac{1000 \times (1 \times 10^{-10}) \times (40 \times 10^3)}{108}
\]

Calculate step-by-step:

- Numerator:  
  \( 1000 \times 10^{-10} \times 40 \times 10^3 = 40 \times 10^{-4} = 4 \times 10^{-3} \)

- Then:  
  \( S_i = \frac{4 \times 10^{-3}}{108} \approx 3.7037 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W} \)

---

\[
s(t) = A_c \left(1 + \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t)\right) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

with:
- \( A_c = 10 \, \text{V} \)
- \( \mu = 0.4 \)

This is standard amplitude modulation (AM), where the carrier frequency is \( f_c \) and the modulating frequency is \( f_m \).

---

### Step 1: Express \( s(t) \) in terms of complex exponentials or use trig identities

Use the identity:

\[
\cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t) \right]
\]

So,

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

Now expand the second term using the identity above:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t) \right]
\]

So now we have:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t)
\]

---

### Step 2: Take Fourier Transform to get \( S(f) \)

The Fourier transform of \( \cos(2\pi f_0 t) \) is:

\[
\mathcal{F}\{\cos(2\pi f_0 t)\} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0) \right]
\]

Apply this to each term:

1. For \( A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) \):

\[
A_c \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left[ \delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c) \right] = \frac{A_c}{2} \delta(f - f_c) + \frac{A_c}{2} \delta(f + f_c)
\]

2. For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) \):

\[
\frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left[ \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m)) \right] = \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f + (f_c + f_m))
\]

3. Similarly for \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t) \):

\[
\frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f + (f_c - f_m))
\]

---

### Final Expression for \( S(f) \)

\[
S(f) = \frac{A_c}{2} \delta(f - f_c) + \frac{A_c}{2} \delta(f + f_c) \\
+ \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f + (f_c + f_m)) \\
+ \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \delta(f + (f_c - f_m))
\]

---

### Impulse Magnitudes at ±f_c and ±(f_c±f_m)

From the above:

- At \( \pm f_c \):  
  Each impulse has magnitude \( \frac{A_c}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{V} \)

- At \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \):  
  Each impulse has magnitude \( \frac{A_c \mu}{4} = \frac{10 \times 0.4}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \, \text{V} \)

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

- Impulse magnitudes at \( \pm f_c \): **5 V**

- SNR = 8 dB

First, convert SNR from dB to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{8}{10}} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096

Now plug into the formula:

### Step 1: Define outage
An outage occurs when the instantaneous SNR γ is **less than** γ_min.  
Here, γ_min = 1.

So, outage happens when γ < 1 → only γ = 0.1 qualifies.

From the set:
- γ = 0.1 → outage
- γ = 1 → not an outage (since γ ≥ γ_min)
- γ = 3.162 and 10 → no outage

"Compute AM bandwidth. Message bandwidth W=7 kHz. For standard AM (DSB with carrier), what is RF bandwidth?","For standard AM (Double Sideband with Carrier, DSB-SC is sometimes confused, but ""standard AM"" typically refers to DSB with carrier), the RF bandwidth is determined by the message signal bandwidth.

Given:
- Message bandwidth \( W = 7 \) kHz

In standard AM (DSB with carrier):
- The modulated signal contains the carrier and two sidebands (upper and lower).
- Each sideband has a bandwidth equal to the message bandwidth.
- Therefore, total RF bandwidth = 2 × message bandwidth

\[
\text{RF Bandwidth} = 2 \times W = 2 \times 7 \text{ kHz} = 14 \text{ kHz}
\]

"Noise power in band. Two-sided PSD N0/2=2×10^{-12} W/Hz, bandpass filter equivalent noise bandwidth B=50 kHz (one-sided around carrier). Compute total noise power passed (assume both sidebands, total bandwidth 2B).","We are given:

- Two-sided power spectral density (PSD):  
  \[
  \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz}
  \]
  So the one-sided PSD is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \), and the two-sided PSD is \( N_0 \).

- Equivalent noise bandwidth of the bandpass filter:  
  \[
  B = 50 \, \text{kHz} \quad \text{(one-sided around carrier)}
  \]

- The total bandwidth of interest is \( 2B = 100 \, \text{kHz} \) — this includes both sidebands.

We are to compute the **total noise power passed** through the bandpass filter.

---

### Step 1: Understand the noise PSD
The two-sided PSD is:
\[
S_{xx}(f) = \frac{N_0}{2} \quad \text{(in W/Hz)}
\]
This means that over the entire frequency range (both positive and negative frequencies), the noise power per Hz is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \).

But since the filter is bandpass and centered at a carrier frequency, and we’re told it has an equivalent noise bandwidth of \( B = 50 \, \text{kHz} \) (one-sided), then the total noise power in the passband is:

\[
P_n = \left( \frac{N_0}{2} \right) \times (2B)
\]

Wait — let’s be precise here.

In practice, for a bandpass filter:
- The **equivalent noise bandwidth** \( B_e \) is defined such that the noise power is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \times 2B_e \) for a two-sided PSD.
- But if you're given \( B = 50 \, \text{kHz} \) as the **one-sided equivalent noise bandwidth**, then the effective noise bandwidth for a two-sided spectrum is still \( B \) on each side — so the total equivalent bandwidth (for noise power integration) is \( 2B \).

Actually, in standard communications engineering:

If the **one-sided** equivalent noise bandwidth is \( B \) (e.g., from \( f_c - B \) to \( f_c + B \)), then:

- The noise power is computed using the total bandwidth \( 2B \) and the **two-sided** PSD \( \frac{N_0}{2} \):

\[
P_n = \left( \frac{N_0}{2} \right) \times (2B)
\]

Because:
- \( \frac{N_0}{2} \) is the power per Hz (two-sided).
- The total bandwidth of interest is \( 2B = 100 \, \text{kHz} \).

So:

\[
P_n = \frac{N_0}{2} \times 2B = N_0 \cdot B
\]

But wait — we must use actual values.

From the problem:  
\[
\frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz}
\Rightarrow N_0 = 4 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

Now, total noise power passed:

\[
P_n = \left( \frac{N_0}{2} \right) \times (2B) = (2 \times 10^{-12}) \times (2 \times 50 \times 10^3)
\]

Let’s compute:

- \( 2B = 100 \, \text{kHz} = 10^5 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

Then:

\[
P_n = (2 \times 10^{-12}) \times (10^5) = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{W}

"For Gray-coded 16-QAM, require p_b≈10^{-3} using p_b≈(3/4)Q(\sqrt{4γ_b/5}). Find E_b/N_0 in dB.","We are given a Gray-coded 16-QAM system and asked to find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) in dB such that the bit error rate (BER) is approximately \( p_b = 10^{-3} \).

We are provided with an approximate BER formula:

\[
p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right)
\]

where:
- \( p_b \) is the bit error rate,
- \( \gamma_b = E_b / N_0 \),
- \( Q(x) \) is the standard Q-function, defined as:

\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation
We want:
\[
\frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = 10^{-3}
\]

Solve for \( \gamma_b \):

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{4}{3000} = \frac{1}{750} \approx 0.001333...
\]

So we need:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = 0.001333
\]

Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \Rightarrow Q(x) = 0.001333
\]

Now, find \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 0.001333 \)

From standard Q-function tables or using numerical approximation:

- \( Q(2.8) \approx 0.00256 \)
- \( Q(2.9) \approx 0.00187 \)
- \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.00135 \)
- \( Q(3.01) \approx 0.00131 \)

Interpolating between 3.0 and 3.01:

At \( x = 3.0 \), \( Q(x) = 0.00135 \)  
At \( x = 3.01 \), \( Q(x) ≈ 0.00131 \)

We want \( Q(x) = 0.001333 \). Close to 3.0.

Use linear interpolation:

\[
x \approx 3.0 + \frac{0.00135 - 0.001333}{0.00135 - 0.00131} \times 0.01
= 3.0 + \frac{0.000017}{0.00004} \times 0.01
= 3.0 + 0.425 \times 0.01
= 3.0 + 0.00425 = 3.00425
\]

So approximately, \( x \approx 3.004 \)

Now recall:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} = 3.004
\]

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{4\gamma_b}{5} = (3.004)^2 \approx 9.024
\]

Solve for \( \gamma_b \):
\[
\gamma_b = \frac{5}{4} \times 9.024 = 1.25 \times 9.024 = 11.28
\]

Thus, \( \gamma_b = E_b/N_0 \approx 11.28 \)

Now convert to dB:
\[
E_b/N_0 \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(11.28) \approx 10 \times 1.052 = 10.52 \, \text{dB}

"Compute group sync length n for false sync ≤ once per day. Bit rate R=50 bit/s, equiprobable bits, no errors allowed (m=0). Use P_f=2^{-n} ≤ 1/(RT).","We are asked to compute the group sync length \( n \) such that the **false synchronization probability** \( P_f \) is **no more than once per day**, given:

- Bit rate \( R = 50 \) bit/s  
- Equiprobable bits (i.e., each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1)  
- No errors allowed (\( m = 0 \))  
- False sync ≤ once per day ⇒ \( P_f \leq \frac{1}{T} \), where \( T \) is 1 day in seconds  

---

### Step 1: Define false sync probability
For a group synchronizer using an \( n \)-bit sync word, and with equiprobable bits and no errors, the probability of a false sync (i.e., a random sequence of \( n \) bits matching the sync word by chance) is:

\[
P_f = 2^{-n}
\]

We are told this must be ≤ once per day. So:

\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{RT}
\]

Where:
- \( R = 50 \) bit/s  
- \( T = 1 \) day = \( 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 86,400 \) seconds

So:

\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{50 \times 86400}
\]

Compute denominator:

\[
50 \times 86400 = 4,320,000
\]

Thus:

\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{4,\!320,\!000}
\]

Take log base 2 of both sides:

\[
-n \leq \log_2\left(\frac{1}{4,\!320,\!000}\right)
= -\log_2(4,\!320,\!000)
\]

Multiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):

\[
n \geq \log_2(4,\!320,\!000)
\]

Now compute \( \log_2(4,\!320,\!000) \):

Use change of base:

\[
\log_2(4,\!320,\!000) = \frac{\log_{10}(4,\!320,\!000)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{6.6355}{0.3010} \approx 22.04

So:

\[
n \geq 22.04

Since \( n \) must be an integer, round up:

\[

- At input = **−6 dBm**:
  - Desired output = **20 dBm**
  - IM3 = **−10 dBm**

We are asked to find the **input level where IM3 equals the desired output**, i.e., when:
\[
\text{IM3} = \text{Desired Output}
\]

---

### Step 1: Express both as functions of input

Let the input be \( x \) (in dBm).

#### Desired Output:
Since it increases 1 dB per 1 dB input, and at \( x = -6 \), desired output = 20 dBm,
\[
\text{Desired}(x) = 20 + (x - (-6)) = 20 + x + 6 = x + 26
\]

#### IM3:
It increases 3 dB per 1 dB input. At \( x = -6 \), IM3 = −10 dBm.

So:
\[
\text{IM3}(x) = -10 + 3(x - (-6)) = -10 + 3(x + 6) = -10 + 3x + 18 = 3x + 8
\]

---

### Step 2: Set them equal and solve for x

Set:
\[
\text{Desired}(x) = \text{IM3}(x)

### Given:
- **Shadowing standard deviation (σ)** = 10 dB  
- **Outage threshold (P_th)** = 5 dBm  
- **Mean received power (μ)** = 15 dBm  

The received power \( P_r \) follows a **log-normal distribution**, meaning the logarithm of \( P_r \) is normally distributed:
\[
\log_{10}(P_r) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)

### Outage Probability Definition:
Outage occurs when the received power drops below the threshold:

"CDMA capacity. Spreading factor M_c=64, SIR threshold 4 dB, N_r=4 ideal antennas. Estimate users N≈M_c N_r/γ_th.","To estimate the number of users \( N \) in a CDMA system using the given parameters:

- Spreading factor \( M_c = 64 \)
- SIR (Signal-to-Interference Ratio) threshold \( \gamma_{\text{th}} = 4 \, \text{dB} \)
- Number of receive antennas \( N_r = 4 \)
- Ideal antennas (i.e., no spatial interference, perfect beamforming or combining)

The formula provided is:

\[
N \approx \frac{M_c \cdot N_r}{\gamma_{\text{th}}}
\]

But we must be careful: the threshold \( \gamma_{\text{th}} \) must be in **linear scale**, not dB.

### Step 1: Convert SIR threshold from dB to linear scale
\[
\gamma_{\text{th}} = 10^{4/10} = 10^{0.4} \approx 2.5119

A channel has capacity per Hz C/B=2 bit/s/Hz. Find SNR in dB.,"We are given the channel capacity per Hz:

\[
\frac{C}{B} = 2 \, \text{bit/s/Hz}
\]

This is the **spectral efficiency**, often denoted as \( C/B \), and it's related to the **Shannon-Hartley theorem**:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Dividing both sides by \( B \):

\[
\frac{C}{B} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Substitute the given value:

\[
2 = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Now solve for SNR:

1. Convert from log base 2 to exponential form:
\[
1 + \text{SNR} = 2^2 = 4
\]

2. Subtract 1:
\[
\text{SNR} = 4 - 1 = 3
\]

Now convert SNR to dB:

\[

"M-ary requirement. Bandwidth fixed, roll-off α=0.25. Compared to binary (M=2), information rate must triple. What M is needed assuming η∝log2 M?","We are given:

- Bandwidth \( B \) is fixed.
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.25 \).
- The information rate must **triple** compared to binary (M=2).
- Efficiency \( \eta \propto \log_2 M \), where \( \eta \) is the spectral efficiency (bits/s/Hz).

### Step 1: Spectral Efficiency
For a system with roll-off \( \alpha \), the maximum symbol rate \( R_s \) in a bandwidth \( B \) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Spectral efficiency \( \eta \) (in bits/s/Hz) is:

\[
\eta = R_s \cdot \log_2 M = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2 M
\]

Since \( B \) and \( \alpha \) are constant, \( \eta \propto \log_2 M \), as stated.

### Step 2: Compare with Binary (M=2)
For binary (M=2):

\[
\eta_2 = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2 2 = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot 1
\]

We want the new information rate to be tripled — that means the new spectral efficiency \( \eta_M \) must satisfy:

\[
\eta_M = 3 \eta_2
\]

So:

\[
\frac{B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2 M = 3 \cdot \frac{B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot 1
\]

Cancel \( \frac{B}{1 + \alpha} \) from both sides:

\[
\log_2 M = 3
\]

Therefore:

\[
M = 2^3 = 8
\]

- SNR values (γ): {10, 3.162, 1, 0.1}
- Probabilities: {0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25} → each SNR occurs with equal probability
- γ_min = 1 (threshold for successful transmission)
- Outage occurs when γ < γ_min
- Outage capacity is defined as:
  
  \[
  \frac{C}{B} = (1 - p_{\text{out}}) \log_2(1 + \gamma_{\min})
  \]

---

### Step 1: Compute outage probability \( p_{\text{out}} \)

Outage happens when the SNR is **less than** γ_min = 1.

From the list of γ values:
- γ = 10 → ✅ ≥ 1 → no outage
- γ = 3.162 → ✅ ≥ 1 → no outage
- γ = 1 → ✅ = 1 → not less than 1 → no outage
- γ = 0.1 → ❌ < 1 → outage

So only one out of four cases causes an outage.

Therefore:
\[
p_{\text{out}} = P(\gamma < 1) = P(\gamma = 0.1) = 0.25
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into outage capacity formula

\[
\frac{C}{B} = (1 - p_{\text{out}}) \log_2(1 + \gamma_{\min}) = (1 - 0.25) \log_2(1 + 1) = 0.75 \cdot \log_2(2)

### Step 1: Determine the total range
The signal spans from −3 V to +3 V, so the total range is:

\[
\text{Range} = 3 - (-3) = 6 \, \text{V}
\]

### Step 2: Use the formula for uniform quantizer step size
For a uniform quantizer with L levels over a range R, the step size Δ is:

"A (7,4) codeword is received as r=1101101 and the syndrome is s=[0 0 1]. If the syndrome corresponds to column 7 in H, which bit position is in error?","We are given:

- A (7,4) codeword is received as:  
  **r = 1101101**  
- The syndrome is:  
  **s = [0 0 1]**
- The syndrome corresponds to **column 7** of the parity-check matrix **H**

### Goal:
Determine which bit position is in error.

---

### Key Concept:
In linear block codes (like Hamming codes), the **syndrome s = H × rᵀ** tells us the **error pattern**. If there's a single-bit error in position *i*, then the syndrome equals the *i*-th column of H.

So, if the syndrome matches column *j* of H, it means the error occurred in bit position *j*.

Here, we're told:
> ""The syndrome corresponds to column 7 in H""

This directly implies that the error is in **bit position 7**.

But wait — let’s confirm whether positions are **1-based or 0-based**.

In coding theory, bit positions are typically **1-based**, especially when referring to the position in the codeword sequence.

Our received word is:

```
Position:   1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Received:   1 1 0 1 1 0 1
```

So, if the syndrome corresponds to **column 7**, the error is in **position 7**.

That means the **7th bit** is incorrect.

Current value at position 7: **1**  
So the correct bit should be flipped: **0**

Therefore, the corrected codeword would be:  
**1101100**

"For OFDM Rayleigh model Pr(r>A0)=exp(-A0^2), find A0 for clipping probability 5%.","We are given the probability of outage (or clipping) in an OFDM Rayleigh fading channel:

\[
P_r(r > A_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2}\right)
\]

Wait — note: The expression you provided is:

> Pr(r > A₀) = exp(−A₀²)

This implies that the power (or amplitude squared) follows an exponential distribution with mean 1, i.e., if \( r \sim \text{Rayleigh}(1) \), then \( r^2 \sim \text{Exp}(1) \). So your formula likely assumes normalized variance or unit average power.

But to match standard Rayleigh distribution:
- If \( r \sim \text{Rayleigh}(\sigma) \), then \( P(r > A_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \)

If no parameter is given, assume **unit variance**, i.e., \( \sigma = 1 \), so:

\[
P(r > A_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2}\right)
\]

However, in your problem, it's written as:

\[
P(r > A_0) = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

So this must imply a **different normalization**—namely, that the **power** (not amplitude) follows an exponential distribution with mean 1. That is, \( r^2 \sim \text{Exp}(1) \), meaning the Rayleigh distribution has scale parameter \( \sigma = 1/\sqrt{2} \).

Let’s proceed based on the equation you gave:

\[
P(r > A_0) = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

We want the clipping probability to be 5%, i.e.,

\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.05
\]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.05)
\]
\[
A_0^2 = -\ln(0.05)

\[
A_0 = \sqrt{-\ln(0.05)}

"A squaring-loop SSB carrier recovery: LPF output after squaring is 0.5[m^2(t)+mhat^2(t)]. If m(t)=cosω_mt, what is time-average of LPF output?","We are given:

- A squaring-loop SSB carrier recovery system.
- The LPF output after squaring is:  
  \[
  0.5 \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]
  \]
- The message signal is:  
  \[
  m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t)
  \]

We are asked to compute the **time-average** of the LPF output.

---

### Step 1: Understand the expression

The LPF output is:

\[
y(t) = 0.5 \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]
\]

We are told that \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \), so we can compute \( m^2(t) \):

\[
m^2(t) = \cos^2(\omega_m t) = \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2}
\]

Now, what about \( \hat{m}(t) \)? In a typical squaring-loop carrier recovery setup for SSB, \( \hat{m}(t) \) is the quadrature component (or imaginary part) of the analytic signal of \( m(t) \). For a cosine message, its Hilbert transform is:

\[
\hat{m}(t) = \sin(\omega_m t)
\]

Therefore:

\[
\hat{m}^2(t) = \sin^2(\omega_m t) = \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the expression

\[
y(t) = 0.5 \left[ \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2} + \frac{1 - \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2} \right]
\]

Simplify inside the brackets:

\[
= 0.5 \left[ \frac{1 + \cos(2\omega_m t) + 1 - \cos(2\omega_m t)}{2} \right]
= 0.5 \left[ \frac{2}{2} \right] = 0.5 \times 1 = 0.5
\]

So, \( y(t) = 0.5 \), a constant!

---

### Step 3: Time-average

Since \( y(t) = 0.5 \) (constant over time), the time-average is simply:

\[
\langle y(t) \rangle = 0.5
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{0.5}

"Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ=60°. If ideal (φ=0) requires E_b/N_0=8 dB for a target BER, what additional SNR penalty (dB) is needed due to phase offset, assuming decision variable scales by cosφ?","We are given:

- Coherent BPSK with a phase offset φ = 60°
- Ideal case (φ = 0) requires E_b/N₀ = 8 dB for a target BER
- The decision variable scales by cos(φ) due to the phase offset
- Need to find the additional SNR penalty (in dB) caused by this phase offset

---

### Step 1: Understand the impact of phase offset

In coherent BPSK, the received signal is demodulated using a local oscillator that ideally matches the carrier phase. If there is a phase offset φ, the effective decision variable (the in-phase component used for detection) is scaled by **cos(φ)**.

This means:
- The signal energy at the detector is reduced by a factor of cos²(φ)
- Since noise power remains unchanged, the effective SNR decreases by the same factor.

So the effective SNR becomes:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{eff}} = \text{SNR}_{\text{ideal}} \cdot \cos^2(\phi)
\]

But since we're comparing the required E_b/N₀ (which is proportional to SNR), and BER depends on SNR, we must increase the input E_b/N₀ to compensate for the loss.

Let’s compute the penalty.

---

### Step 2: Compute cos²(φ)

Given φ = 60°:

\[
\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5 \Rightarrow \cos^2(60^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25
\]

So the received signal is 4× weaker (in terms of energy per bit).

To maintain the same BER, we need to increase the input E_b/N₀ by a factor of 1 / cos²(φ) = 4.

---

### Step 3: Convert multiplicative factor to dB

\[
\text{Penalty (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(4) = 10 \times 0.60206 \approx 6.02 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**6.02 dB**

This is the additional SNR penalty needed due to the 60° phase offset to achieve the same BER as the ideal case.",6.02,0.0,0.03838780000000001
A binary raised-cosine link fits into B=100 kHz with α=1. Find max bit rate.,"To find the maximum bit rate for a binary raised-cosine link, we use the relationship between bandwidth, roll-off factor (α), and symbol rate (Rs).

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 100 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 1 \)

### Formula:
The bandwidth of a raised-cosine filter is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (in symbols per second)
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor
- \( B \) = total bandwidth

For **binary** signaling (i.e., 1 bit per symbol), the bit rate \( R_b = R_s \).

### Solve for \( R_s \):
\[
100 \times 10^3 = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + 1) \\
100 \times 10^3 = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot 2 \\
100 \times 10^3 = R_s
\]

So,
\[
R_s = 100 \text{ kbps}
\]

Since it's binary (1 bit per symbol), the **maximum bit rate** is:

- For coherent SSB-SC:

- Noise at input: \( N_i = 4N_o \)
- Channel attenuation: \( \alpha = 10^{-8} \)
- Transmit power: \( S_t = \frac{S_i}{\alpha} \)

---

### Step 1: Convert output SNR from dB to linear scale
\[
\text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} \Rightarrow \frac{S_o}{N_o} = 10^{30/10} = 10^3 = 1000

So,
\[
\frac{S_o}{N_o} = 1000
\]

---

### Step 2: Use the SSB-SC property
Given:
\[
\frac{S_o}{N_o} = \frac{S_i}{N_i}
\]

Substitute known values:
\[
\frac{S_i}{N_i} = 1000
\]

But \( N_i = 4N_o = 4 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W} \)

A system uses M=64 levels. Compute SQNR under SQNR(dB)=20log10(M).,"We are given:

- Number of levels, \( M = 64 \)
- Formula for SQNR in decibels:  
  \[
  \text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(M)
  \]

### Step-by-step calculation:

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(64)
\]

First, compute \( \log_{10}(64) \):

Since \( 64 = 2^6 \), we can write:
\[
\log_{10}(64) = \log_{10}(2^6) = 6 \log_{10}(2)
\]

We know that \( \log_{10}(2) \approx 0.3010 \), so:

\[
\log_{10}(64) = 6 \times 0.3010 = 1.806
\]

Now multiply by 20:

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \times 1.806 = 36.12 \, \text{dB}

Matched filter for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Find h(t)=s(T-t).,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

This is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \). The unit step function \( U(t) \) ensures the pulse is zero for \( t < 0 \) and turns on at \( t = 0 \), then turns off again at \( t = T/3 \).

### Step 1: Understand the matched filter
The matched filter for a signal \( s(t) \) has impulse response:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

This is the time-reversed and shifted version of \( s(t) \), where the shift is by \( T \) — the total duration we're considering.

So, we need to compute:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

### Step 2: Substitute into the expression
Recall:
\[
s(\tau) = A \left[ U(\tau) - U\left(\tau - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

Now substitute \( \tau = T - t \):

\[
h(t) = s(T - t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( (T - t) - \frac{T}{3} \right) \right]
\]

Simplify the second term:

\[
(T - t) - \frac{T}{3} = \frac{2T}{3} - t
\]

So:

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right]
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
This expression describes a rectangular pulse in terms of \( t \), but it's flipped in time due to the \( T - t \) substitution.

Let’s understand the support (where the function is non-zero):

- \( U(T - t) \) is 1 when \( T - t \geq 0 \Rightarrow t \leq T \)
- \( U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \) is 1 when \( \frac{2T}{3} - t \geq 0 \Rightarrow t \leq \frac{2T}{3} \)

So:
- For \( t > T \): both step functions are 0 ⇒ \( h(t) = 0 \)
- For \( \frac{2T}{3} < t \leq T \): only \( U(T - t) = 1 \), so \( h(t) = A \)
- For \( t \leq \frac{2T}{3} \): both are 1 ⇒ \( h(t) = A(1 - 1) = 0 \)

Therefore, \( h(t) \) is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \) that starts at \( t = \frac{2T}{3} \) and ends at \( t = T \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right]}
\]

Or equivalently, as a rectangular pulse:

### Step 1: Use the outage probability formula for log-normal distribution

For a log-normal shadowing model, the received power \( P_r \) is normally distributed in dB:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

The outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \), so:

A uniform PCM system uses n=10 bits/sample over amplitude range 5 V. Find quantization step Δ.,"To find the quantization step size Δ in a uniform Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) system:

### Given:
- Number of bits per sample, \( n = 10 \)
- Amplitude range = 5 V (this is typically the full range from minimum to maximum value)

In PCM systems, the amplitude range is usually from \(-V_{\text{max}}\) to \(+V_{\text{max}}\), so if the total range is 5 V, then:
- The full amplitude range \( R = 5 \) V
- This implies the signal spans from \(-2.5\) V to \(+2.5\) V

However, sometimes ""amplitude range 5 V"" means from 0 to 5 V — this must be clarified.

But in most standard PCM contexts (especially with uniform quantization), if not specified otherwise, the range is assumed symmetric around zero unless stated otherwise.

Let’s proceed with both interpretations and clarify:

---

### ✅ Standard Interpretation (Symmetric Range):
- Full range \( R = 5 \) V → from \(-2.5\) V to \(+2.5\) V  
- Number of quantization levels \( L = 2^n = 2^{10} = 1024 \)
- Quantization step size \( \Delta = \frac{R}{L} = \frac{5}{1024} \)

**So:**
\[
\Delta = \frac{5}{1024} = 0.0048828125 \, \text{V} = 4.883 \, \text{mV}

Laplacian noise detector: noiseless outputs 0 or A with equal priors and noise pdf f(n)=(1/(2λ))exp(-|n|/λ). Find optimal threshold V_d.,"To find the optimal threshold \( V_d \) for a **Laplacian noise detector**, we are given:

- The signal is binary:  
  - Noiseless output is either 0 or \( A \), each with equal prior probability:  
    \( P(0) = P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Additive Laplacian noise \( n \sim f(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|n|/\lambda} \)
- Observed signal: \( y = s + n \), where \( s \in \{0, A\} \)

We want to find the **optimal detection threshold \( V_d \)** that minimizes the probability of error in deciding whether \( s = 0 \) or \( s = A \), based on observation \( y \).

---

### Step 1: Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)

The optimal decision rule under equal priors and minimum probability of error is:

\[
\text{Decide } s = A \quad \text{if} \quad \frac{f(y|s=A)}{f(y|s=0)} > 1
\]

This is equivalent to comparing the likelihoods.

Let’s compute the two likelihoods:

#### When \( s = 0 \):  
\( y = n \), so  
\[
f(y|s=0) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y|/\lambda}
\]

#### When \( s = A \):  
\( y = A + n \), so  
\[
f(y|s=A) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda}
\]

Now form the likelihood ratio:
\[
\Lambda(y) = \frac{f(y|s=A)}{f(y|s=0)} = \frac{e^{-|y - A|/\lambda}}{e^{-|y|/\lambda}} = e^{-(|y - A| - |y|)/\lambda}
\]

So the LRT becomes:

\[
\Lambda(y) > 1 \iff \frac{|y| - |y - A|}{\lambda} > 0 \iff |y| > |y - A|
\]

This inequality defines the decision region.

---

### Step 2: Find where \( |y| = |y - A| \)

Solve:
\[
|y| = |y - A|
\]

This equation occurs when \( y = \frac{A}{2} \). This is the point where the distances from 0 and from \( A \) are equal — geometrically, it's the midpoint.

- For \( y > \frac{A}{2} \), \( |y| > |y - A| \) → decide \( s = A \)
- For \( y < \frac{A}{2} \), \( |y| < |y - A| \) → decide \( s = 0 \)

Therefore, the optimal threshold is:

\[
V_d = \frac{A}{2}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{V_d = \frac{A}{2}}

QPSK RC system has B=20 kHz and α=0.5. Find max bit rate.,"To find the maximum bit rate for a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) system with a raised cosine (RC) filter, we use the relationship between bandwidth, roll-off factor, and symbol rate.

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 20 \text{ kHz} \)
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.5 \)

### Step 1: Symbol Rate (\( R_s \))
For a raised cosine filter, the bandwidth is given by:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2}(1 + \alpha)
\]

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}

"Telephone band 300–3400 Hz. Using QPSK with RRC roll-off α=0.35, available RF bandwidth is 3100 Hz. What maximum bit rate fits (ignore guard bands)?","We are given:

- **Telephone band**: 300–3400 Hz → Total bandwidth = 3400 − 300 = **3100 Hz**
- **Modulation**: QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)
- **RRC (Root Raised Cosine) roll-off factor**: α = 0.35
- **Available RF bandwidth**: 3100 Hz
- **Goal**: Find the **maximum bit rate** that fits in this bandwidth, ignoring guard bands.

---

### Step 1: Understand QPSK spectral efficiency

QPSK transmits **2 bits per symbol** (since it uses 4 phases).

So, if the symbol rate is \( R_s \), then the bit rate is:

\[
R_b = 2 \cdot R_s
\]

---

### Step 2: Bandwidth of a QPSK signal with RRC filtering

For a baseband signal with RRC pulse shaping, the required bandwidth for a symbol rate \( R_s \) is:

\[
B = R_s (1 + \alpha)/2
\]

But here we're dealing with a **passband** (RF) signal — and QPSK is typically transmitted as a passband signal using quadrature modulation. In passband, the occupied bandwidth is approximately:

\[
B_{\text{passband}} = R_s (1 + \alpha)
\]

This is because the baseband equivalent signal has bandwidth \( R_s(1+\alpha)/2 \), but when upconverted to passband, the total occupied bandwidth becomes \( R_s(1 + \alpha) \).

✅ So for passband QPSK with RRC filter:

\[
B = R_s (1 + \alpha)
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for symbol rate \( R_s \)

Given:
- \( B = 3100 \) Hz
- \( \alpha = 0.35 \)

\[
3100 = R_s (1 + 0.35) = R_s \cdot 1.35
\]

\[
R_s = \frac{3100}{1.35} \approx 2296.3 \text{ symbols/second}
\]

---

### Step 4: Convert to bit rate

Since QPSK carries 2 bits per symbol:

\[
R_b = 2 \cdot R_s = 2 \cdot 2296.3 \approx 4592.6 \text{ bps}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

OFDM clipping. Pr(r>A0)=exp(-A0^2). Find A0 for Pr=0.05.,"We are given the probability:

\[
\Pr(r > A_0) = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

and we are asked to find \( A_0 \) such that this probability equals 0.05:

\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.05
\]

### Step 1: Take the natural logarithm of both sides
\[
\ln\left(\exp(-A_0^2)\right) = \ln(0.05)
\]
\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.05)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( A_0 \)
\[
A_0^2 = -\ln(0.05)
\]
\[
A_0 = \sqrt{-\ln(0.05)}
\]

### Step 3: Compute the value
First, calculate \( \ln(0.05) \):

\[
\ln(0.05) \approx \ln(5 \times 10^{-2}) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^{-2}) \approx 1.6094 - 4.6052 = -2.9957

So:
\[
A_0 = \sqrt{-(-2.9957)} = \sqrt{2.9957} \approx 1.731

"Water-filling normalized power allocation. Cutoff γ_0=0.8. For state γ=0.5, compute S(γ)/S.","To compute \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) for a water-filling normalized power allocation with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \) and state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), we follow the principles of water-filling in communication theory (e.g., for Gaussian channels).

---

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

- **Water-filling power allocation** distributes power across frequency bins (or channel states) such that more power goes to better channels.
- The **cutoff** \( \gamma_0 \) defines the minimum SNR level below which no power is allocated (i.e., ""empty"" or zero power).
- For a given channel state \( \gamma \), the allocated power is:
  
  \[
  P(\gamma) = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right)^+
  \]
  
  where \( (x)^+ = \max(x, 0) \), meaning if the expression inside is negative, we set it to zero.

- The total power \( S \) is the integral (or sum) over all states of \( P(\gamma) \), i.e.,
  
  \[
  S = \int P(\gamma) \, d\gamma
  \]

- The **normalized power** for a specific state \( \gamma \) is:
  
  \[
  \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{P(\gamma)}{S}
  \]

---

### ✅ Step-by-step Computation:

Given:
- \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \)
- \( \gamma = 0.5 \)

Check if power is allocated at this state:

\[
P(\gamma) = \left( \frac{1}{0.8} - \frac{1}{0.5} \right)^+ = \left( 1.25 - 2 \right)^+ = (-0.75)^+ = 0
\]

So, \( P(\gamma) = 0 \) when \( \gamma < \gamma_0 \).  
Since \( \gamma = 0.5 < \gamma_0 = 0.8 \), **no power is allocated** to this state.

Therefore:
\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0}{S} = 0
\]

\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = 0

- A **noncoherent orthogonal BFSK** (Binary Frequency Shift Keying) system.
- Target bit error rate (BER): \( P_b = 10^{-2} \)
- The BER formula for noncoherent orthogonal BFSK:  
  \[
  P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\gamma_b / 2}
  \]
  where \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) is the bit energy-to-noise ratio in linear scale.

We are to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Plug in the target BER
\[
\frac{1}{2} e^{-\gamma_b / 2} = 10^{-2}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
e^{-\gamma_b / 2} = 2 \times 10^{-2} = 0.02
\]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-\frac{\gamma_b}{2} = \ln(0.02)
\]

Calculate \( \ln(0.02) \):
\[
\ln(0.02) = \ln(2 \times 10^{-2}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-2}) = \ln(2) - 2 \ln(10)
\]
\[
\approx 0.6931 - 2 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 4.6052 = -3.9121
\]

So:
\[
-\frac{\gamma_b}{2} = -3.9121 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\gamma_b}{2} = 3.9121
\]
\[
\gamma_b = 7.8242
\]

This is \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in linear scale.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Total number of chips in one sequence period** = 1023

- Formula for SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio) in decibels:
  \[
  \text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(M)
  \]

### Step-by-step calculation:

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(512)
\]

First, express 512 as a power of 2:
\[
512 = 2^9

So:
\[
\log_{10}(512) = \log_{10}(2^9) = 9 \log_{10}(2)

Therefore:
\[
\log_{10}(512) \approx 9 \times 0.3010 = 2.709

Coherent BPSK over AWGN. Find the minimum E_b/N_0 (in dB) required to achieve P_b = 10^{-5}.,"To find the minimum \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) (in dB) required to achieve a bit error probability \( P_b = 10^{-5} \) for **coherent BPSK over AWGN**, we use the well-known analytical expression for the bit error rate of BPSK:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( Q(x) \) is the standard Gaussian Q-function,
- \( E_b \) is the energy per bit,
- \( N_0 \) is the noise power spectral density.

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation
We want:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 10^{-5}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-5}
\]

From tables or numerical evaluation:
\[
Q^{-1}(10^{-5}) \approx 4.2649
\]

So:
\[
x = 4.2649 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.2649
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.2649)^2 \approx 18.187

- SNR states: \( \gamma = \{5, 2, 1, 0.5\} \)  
- Corresponding probabilities: \( \{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3\} \)  
- Outage threshold: \( \gamma_{\text{min}} = 1 \)

---

### 🔍 Step 1: Understand Outage Capacity
Outage capacity is the maximum rate (in bits/sec/Hz) that can be supported with a specified outage probability — i.e., the capacity one can achieve when the channel is ""good enough"" (i.e., \( \gamma \geq \gamma_{\text{min}} \)).

In this context, it's defined as:
\[
\frac{C}{B} = \mathbb{E}[\log_2(1 + \gamma)] \quad \text{for } \gamma \geq \gamma_{\text{min}}
\]
But more precisely, in outage capacity, we only average over the channel states where \( \gamma \geq \gamma_{\text{min}} \), and we must **normalize** by the probability that the channel is not in outage (i.e., \( P(\gamma \geq \gamma_{\text{min}}) \)).

So:
\[
\frac{C}{B} = \frac{1}{P(\gamma \geq \gamma_{\text{min}})} \sum_{\gamma \geq \gamma_{\text{min}}} P(\gamma) \cdot \log_2(1 + \gamma)
\]

---

### ✅ Step 2: Identify States ≥ γ_min = 1
From \( \gamma = \{5, 2, 1, 0.5\} \), the states with \( \gamma \geq 1 \) are:
- \( \gamma = 5 \) → prob = 0.1
- \( \gamma = 2 \) → prob = 0.2
- \( \gamma = 1 \) → prob = 0.4  
(We exclude 0.5 since it’s < 1)

Total probability of no outage:
\[
P(\gamma \geq 1) = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.7
\]

---

### 🔢 Step 3: Compute Expected Log Capacity Over Good States

Compute sum:
\[
\sum_{\gamma \geq 1} P(\gamma) \cdot \log_2(1 + \gamma)
= 0.1 \cdot \log_2(6) + 0.2 \cdot \log_2(3) + 0.4 \cdot \log_2(2)
\]

Use log base 2 values:
- \( \log_2(6) \approx 2.585 \)
- \( \log_2(3) \approx 1.585 \)
- \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)

Now calculate:
\[
= 0.1 \cdot 2.585 + 0.2 \cdot 1.585 + 0.4 \cdot 1 \\
= 0.2585 + 0.317 + 0.4 = 0.9755

Compute received power needed for DBPSK BER 10^{-5} at R_b=2 Mbit/s with N0=3.18×10^{-20} W/Hz. Use γ_b=ln(1/(2P_b)).,"We are asked to compute the **received power** \( P_r \) needed for a DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) system to achieve a Bit Error Rate (BER) of \( 10^{-5} \), given:

- Bit rate: \( R_b = 2 \, \text{Mbit/s} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{bit/s} \)
- Noise power spectral density: \( N_0 = 3.18 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- BER target: \( P_b = 10^{-5} \)
- Formula provided:  
  \[
  \gamma_b = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2P_b}\right)
  \]

---

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma_b \)

Given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-5}
\]
\[
\gamma_b = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-5}}\right) = \ln\left(5 \times 10^4\right)
\]

Calculate:
\[
\ln(5 \times 10^4) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^4) = \ln(5) + 4 \ln(10)
\]

Use approximations:
- \( \ln(5) \approx 1.6094 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
\gamma_b \approx 1.6094 + 4 \times 2.3026 = 1.6094 + 9.2104 = 10.8198
\]

Thus:
\[
\gamma_b \approx 10.82
\]

---

### Step 2: Relate \( \gamma_b \) to received power

For DBPSK, the energy per bit is:
\[
E_b = \frac{P_r}{R_b}
\]
And the signal-to-noise ratio per bit is:
\[
\gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{P_r / R_b}{N_0}
\Rightarrow P_r = \gamma_b \cdot R_b \cdot N_0
\]

Plug in values:
- \( \gamma_b = 10.82 \)
- \( R_b = 2 \times 10^6 \)
- \( N_0 = 3.18 \times 10^{-20} \)

\[
P_r = 10.82 \times 2 \times 10^6 \times 3.18 \times 10^{-20}
\]

First multiply constants:
\[
10.82 \times 2 = 21.64
\]
\[
21.64 \times 3.18 = ?
\]

Compute:
\[
21.64 \times 3.18 = (20 + 1.64) \times 3.18 = 20 \times 3.18 + 1.64 \times 3.18
\]
- \( 20 \times 3.18 = 63.6 \)
- \( 1.64 \times 3.18 \approx 5.22 \)

So total ≈ \( 63.6 + 5.22 = 68.82 \)

Now include the powers of 10:
\[
P_r = 68.82 \times 10^6 \times 10^{-20} = 68.82 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{W}
\]

Convert to scientific notation:
\[
P_r \approx 6.882 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{W}
\]

"Water-filling power allocation. γ0=0.6742, γ=0.2. Find S(γ)/S.","To find \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) in the context of water-filling power allocation, we need to understand what this ratio represents.

In water-filling theory (used in multi-carrier communication systems like OFDM), the total transmit power is allocated across multiple subchannels based on their channel gains. The ""water-filling"" principle allocates more power to better channels.

The quantity \( S(\gamma) \) typically refers to the **total achievable rate** (in bits/s/Hz) when using a water-filling strategy with a minimum SNR threshold \( \gamma \). The total power constraint is often normalized such that \( S \) is the maximum possible rate under full power allocation (or with no noise).

However, in many formulations — especially for the **optimal water-filling solution** — the ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) can be interpreted as:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log_2\left(1 + \gamma_i \right) \Bigg/ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log_2\left(1 + \gamma_i^{\text{max}} \right)
\]

But if we are given:
- \( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \): This is the **water level**, i.e., the minimum SNR after water-filling.
- \( \gamma = 0.2 \): This might represent the **target signal-to-noise ratio** per subchannel or another parameter.

Wait — more likely, in standard notation for water-filling:

- \( \gamma_0 \) is the cutoff SNR (the ""water level"").
- \( \gamma \) is the value at which we compute the rate (possibly the average SNR or a threshold).
- But in some contexts, especially when comparing performance under different SNRs, we use:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{ \int_{\gamma}^{\infty} \log_2\left(1 + \frac{x}{\gamma_0}\right) f_X(x) dx }{ \int_{0}^{\infty} \log_2\left(1 + \frac{x}{\gamma_0}\right) f_X(x) dx }
\]

But this requires knowledge of the distribution \( f_X(x) \), which we don't have here.

Alternatively, there’s a simpler interpretation: In many textbook problems, particularly for the case where the channel gain is constant or a single tone, or for a uniform channel profile, the ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) is computed as:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{ \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) }{ \log_2(1 + \gamma) }
\]

But that doesn’t make sense because \( \gamma_0 > \gamma \), and we’d expect \( S(\gamma) < S \).

Better yet — perhaps the question refers to the **fraction of power used** above a certain threshold.

Alternatively, in digital communications textbooks (e.g., Tse & Viswanath), when you set a power allocation threshold \( \gamma \), the achievable rate is:

\[
S(\gamma) = \sum_{i} \log_2\left(1 + \gamma_i \right) \cdot \mathbb{I}_{\{\gamma_i \geq \gamma\}}
\]

And \( S \) is the total rate without any threshold.

But again, without knowing channel statistics, it's hard.

Wait! There is a well-known result:

If \( \gamma_0 \) is the water level (i.e., the threshold below which no power is allocated), and \( \gamma \) is the actual SNR of a subchannel, then the optimal water-filling power allocation assigns power only where \( \gamma_i \geq \gamma_0 \). So if \( \gamma \) is the threshold, then:

The fraction of the total capacity achieved when using threshold \( \gamma \) relative to full capacity (with no threshold) is:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{ \text{Capacity with water-level } \gamma_0 }{ \text{Total capacity} }
\]

But now, a key insight from classic water-filling:

In the case where all subchannels have equal gain (or when considering average behavior), the ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) is often approximated by:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \approx \frac{ \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) }{ \log_2(1 + \gamma_{\text{avg}}) }
\]

But still not directly helpful.

Wait — I recall a specific scenario: In some problems, you're told that the water-filling solution yields a water level \( \gamma_0 \), and the system uses a fixed SNR \( \gamma \), and you’re to compute the **fraction of the total rate** that is achieved when you only allocate power to subchannels with SNR ≥ γ₀.

Actually, let's look at it differently:

In water-filling, the total power is allocated such that:

\[
P_i = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma_i} \right)^+
\]

Then the total rate is:

\[
S = \sum_i \log_2\left(1 + \gamma_i \right) \cdot \mathbf{1}_{\{\gamma_i \geq \gamma_0\}}
\]

This is confusing.

Hold on — maybe the problem is referring to a very simple case: one subcarrier!

In that case, the water-filling gives a single water level \( \gamma_0 \), and the total rate is \( \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) \), while \( S \) (full power) would be \( \log_2(1 + \gamma) \) where \( \gamma \) is the channel gain.

But here, \( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \), and \( \gamma = 0.2 \). That would mean \( \gamma_0 > \gamma \), but then \( \gamma_0 \) is the water level, so if the channel has SNR \( \gamma = 0.2 < \gamma_0 \), no power is allocated — rate = 0, so \( S(\gamma)/S = 0 \), which seems too trivial.

Alternatively — perhaps \( \gamma \) is the SNR of the channel, and \( \gamma_0 \) is the water level for that channel?

No — this isn't making sense unless we know the distribution.

Let’s try a different approach.

There is a known identity in water-filling theory:

If the water level is \( \gamma_0 \), and the total power is normalized, then the total rate is:

\[
S = \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) \quad \text{(for a single subchannel)}
\]

But if \( \gamma \) is a different SNR, then \( S(\gamma) = \log_2(1 + \gamma) \)

So the ratio is:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{ \log_2(1 + \gamma) }{ \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) }
\]

Now plug in:

\( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \)

\( \gamma = 0.2 \)

Then:

\[
S = \log_2(1 + 0.6742) = \log_2(1.6742) \approx \frac{\ln(1.6742)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.5158}{0.6931} \approx 0.744
\]

\[
S(\gamma) = \log_2(1 + 0.2) = \log_2(1.2) \approx \frac{\ln(1.2)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{0.1823}{0.6931} \approx 0.263
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0.263}{0.744} \approx 0.353
\]

But wait — this assumes that \( S \) is the total rate at the water level, and \( S(\gamma) \) is the rate at a lower SNR. That contradicts the definition.

Actually, the correct interpretation is:

- \( S \): total capacity when using water-filling with water level \( \gamma_0 \)
- \( S(\gamma) \): the capacity when using a different threshold \( \gamma \)

But in standard notation, \( \gamma_0 \) is the water level, so \( S = \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) \), and if \( \gamma \) is a different SNR, then:

We need to know what \( S(\gamma) \) means. If \( \gamma \) is the target SNR (e.g., in a feedback-based system), then we might compute the power required to achieve \( \gamma \):

But without more context, the most plausible interpretation is:

Assume a single subchannel with SNR \( \gamma_0 \), and \( S(\gamma) \) is the rate when the SNR is \( \gamma \). Then:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{ \log_2(1 + \gamma) }{ \log_2(1 + \gamma_0) }
\]

So:

\[
\frac{S(0.2)}{S(0.6742)} = \frac{ \log_2(1.2) }{ \log_2(1.6742) }
\]

Compute numerically:

- \( \log_2(1.2) = \frac{\ln(1.2)}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.1823215567939546}{0.6931471805599453} \approx 0.2630 \)
- \( \log_2(1.6742) = \frac{\ln(1.6742)}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.515803159}{0.693147} \approx 0.7442 \)

Then:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0.2630}{0.7442} \approx 0.3533
\]

"For an AM/SSB squaring method: If s_SSB(t)=m(t)cosω_ct+\hat m(t)sinω_ct, compute the LPF output after squaring.","We are given a Single Sideband (SSB) signal:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}(t) = m(t)\cos(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}(t)\sin(\omega_c t)

where:
- \( m(t) \) is the message signal,
- \( \hat{m}(t) \) is the Hilbert transform of \( m(t) \),
- \( \omega_c \) is the carrier frequency.

We are to **square** this signal and then pass it through a **low-pass filter (LPF)**, and compute the output.

---

### Step 1: Square the SSB signal

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = \left[ m(t)\cos(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}(t)\sin(\omega_c t) \right]^2
\]

Expand the square:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = m^2(t)\cos^2(\omega_c t) + 2m(t)\hat{m}(t)\cos(\omega_c t)\sin(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\sin^2(\omega_c t)
\]

Use trig identities:
- \( \cos^2(\omega_c t) = \frac{1}{2}[1 + \cos(2\omega_c t)] \)
- \( \sin^2(\omega_c t) = \frac{1}{2}[1 - \cos(2\omega_c t)] \)
- \( 2\cos(\omega_c t)\sin(\omega_c t) = \sin(2\omega_c t) \)

Substitute:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = m^2(t)\cdot\frac{1}{2}[1 + \cos(2\omega_c t)] + m(t)\hat{m}(t)\cdot\sin(2\omega_c t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\cdot\frac{1}{2}[1 - \cos(2\omega_c t)]
\]

Group terms:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\right] + \frac{1}{2}\left[m^2(t) - \hat{m}^2(t)\right]\cos(2\omega_c t) + m(t)\hat{m}(t)\sin(2\omega_c t)
\]

---

### Step 2: Pass through a Low-Pass Filter (LPF)

The LPF removes high-frequency components. The term at \( 2\omega_c \) (i.e., \( \cos(2\omega_c t) \), \( \sin(2\omega_c t) \)) will be filtered out.

Therefore, only the DC component remains:

\[
\text{LPF output} = \frac{1}{2}\left[m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\right]

This is the final result.

DBPSK over AWGN. Find required E_b/N_0 (in dB) for BER P_b=10^{-6}.,"To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) for a DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) system over an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 10^{-6} \), we use the analytical BER expression for DBPSK.

---

### Step 1: BER Formula for DBPSK over AWGN

The exact BER for DBPSK is:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

This formula is valid for coherent detection of differentially encoded BPSK, which is what DBPSK typically refers to in this context. It's slightly worse than coherent BPSK due to differential detection.

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( E_b/N_0 \)

We are given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-6}
\]

Substitute into the formula:
\[
10^{-6} = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
2 \times 10^{-6} = \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

Take the natural logarithm:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = -\frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = -\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-6}}\right) = \ln(5 \times 10^5)
\]

Now compute:
\[
\ln(5 \times 10^5) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^5) = \ln(5) + 5 \ln(10)
\]

Use approximations:
- \( \ln(5) \approx 1.6094 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 1.6094 + 5 \times 2.3026 = 1.6094 + 11.513 = 13.1224

- Outage probability \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.1 \) (i.e., 10% outage)
- Threshold power: \( \gamma_{\text{th}} = -20 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of the log-normal fading: \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)

We need to find the **mean power** \( \mu \) (in dBm) such that the probability that the received power falls below the threshold is 10%.

This is a classic problem in wireless communications involving log-normal shadowing.

---

### Step 1: Define the received power

Let \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), where \( X \) is the received signal power in **dBm**.

The outage occurs when:
\[
P(X < \gamma_{\text{th}}) = P_{\text{out}}
\]

So:
\[
P(X < -20) = 0.1
\]

Standardize the variable:
\[
P\left( Z < \frac{-20 - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.1
\]
where \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \).

---

### Step 2: Use the standard normal CDF

We now find the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile:

\[
\Phi\left( \frac{-20 - \mu}{6} \right) = 0.1
\]

From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF (quantile function):
\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.1) = -1.2816
\]

So:
\[
\frac{-20 - \mu}{6} = -1.2816
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \mu \)

Multiply both sides by 6:
\[
-20 - \mu = -7.6896
\]

Then:
\[
-\mu = -7.6896 + 20 = 12.3104
\]

So:
\[
\mu = -12.3104 \, \text{dBm}
\]

- Current code rate = 1/2

- Overhead = 1 - code rate = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2 (50%).

B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

This equation assumes baseband transmission (i.e., no carrier modulation — which matches your case since you're given baseband bandwidth).

- \( B \) = baseband bandwidth = 60 kHz  
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor = 0.4  
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (symbols per second)

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
= \frac{2 \times 60\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.4}
= \frac{120\ \text{kHz}}{1.4}
≈ 85.714\ \text{ksymbols/s}
\]

### Step 2: Convert symbol rate to bit rate

QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) transmits **2 bits per symbol**.

So, maximum bit rate \( R_b \) is:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 85.714\ \text{ksymbols/s} ≈ 171.43\ \text{kbit/s}

"Given noise power -121 dBm and required SNR 18 dB, find required received power.","To find the required received power, we use the relationship between Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), received signal power (P<sub>rx</sub>), and noise power (P<sub>n</sub>):

\[
\text{SNR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{\text{rx}}}{P_n} \right)
\]

Given:
- Noise power \( P_n = -121 \) dBm
- Required SNR = 18 dB

We want to solve for \( P_{\text{rx}} \).

### Step 1: Convert SNR equation to linear form
\[
18 = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{\text{rx}}}{P_n} \right)
\]
Divide both sides by 10:
\[
1.8 = \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_{\text{rx}}}{P_n} \right)

Convert from log to exponential:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{rx}}}{P_n} = 10^{1.8} \approx 63.0957

### Step 2: Solve for \( P_{\text{rx}} \)
\[
P_{\text{rx}} = P_n \times 63.0957

Assume discriminator with G_FM=3β^2(1+β), β=Δf/f_m, and B_FM≈2(Δf+f_m). Find required demodulator input signal power S_i (W).","We are given a single-tone FM system and asked to find the required input signal power \( S_i \) (in watts) to meet a post-detection SNR requirement of 40 dB, using the given parameters.

---

### **Given:**

- Post-detection SNR requirement:  
  \( \text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = 40 \, \text{dB} = 10^{4} \)

- One-sided noise power spectral density:  
  \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

- Message frequency:  
  \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)

- Frequency deviation:  
  \( \Delta f = 20 \, \text{kHz} \)

- Discriminator gain:  
  \( G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) \), where \( \beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} \)

- FM bandwidth approximation:  
  \( B_{\text{FM}} \approx 2(\Delta f + f_m) \)

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Modulation Index β**

\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} = \frac{20 \, \text{kHz}}{5 \, \text{kHz}} = 4
\]

---

### **Step 2: Find Discriminator Gain \( G_{\text{FM}} \)**

\[
G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) = 3 \cdot (4)^2 \cdot (1 + 4) = 3 \cdot 16 \cdot 5 = 240
\]

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Noise Power at Demodulator Output**

The noise power at the output of the demodulator is:

\[
N_o = G_{\text{FM}} \cdot n_0 \cdot B_{\text{FM}}
\]

First, compute \( B_{\text{FM}} \):

\[
B_{\text{FM}} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2(20 + 5) = 50 \, \text{kHz} = 50 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Now plug in values:

\[
N_o = 240 \cdot (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (50 \times 10^3)
\]
\[
N_o = 240 \cdot 2 \cdot 50 \cdot 10^{-8} = 240 \cdot 100 \cdot 10^{-8} = 24000 \cdot 10^{-8} = 2.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{W}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Use Post-Detection SNR to Find Required Signal Power at Demodulator Input**

Post-detection SNR is defined as:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = \frac{S_o}{N_o}
\]

Where \( S_o \) is the signal power at demodulator output.

But for FM, the output signal power \( S_o \) is equal to the input signal power \( S_i \) times the discriminator gain \( G_{\text{FM}} \):

\[
S_o = G_{\text{FM}} \cdot S_i
\]

So,
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = \frac{G_{\text{FM}} \cdot S_i}{N_o}
\]

Solve for \( S_i \):

\[
S_i = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} \cdot N_o}{G_{\text{FM}}}
\]

Plug in the numbers:

- \( \text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = 10^4 \)
- \( N_o = 2.4 \times 10^{-4} \)
- \( G_{\text{FM}} = 240 \)

\[
S_i = \frac{10^4 \cdot 2.4 \times 10^{-4}}{240} = \frac{2.4}{240} = 0.01 \, \text{W}

"If IM3 equals desired at output 35 dBm, what is the input third-order intercept (IIP3) approximately, given 2-tone test at -6 dBm input produced Δ=30 dB between desired (20 dBm) and IM3 (-10 dBm)?","To find the Input Third-Order Intercept (IIP3), we can use the relationship derived from the 2-tone test:

Given:
- Desired signal output power = 35 dBm  
- IM3 (third-order intermodulation product) output power = -10 dBm  
- Δ = difference between desired and IM3 at output = 30 dB  
- Input tone power = -6 dBm  

The key formula relating IIP3 to the measured Δ is:

\[
\Delta = 2 \times (\text{Input Power in dBm} - \text{IIP3 in dBm})
\]

This is because for a 2-tone test, the IM3 power grows at 3× the rate of the fundamental signal. So, if the input power increases by 1 dB, the IM3 increases by 3 dB.

We are told that at an input tone level of -6 dBm, the output Δ = 30 dB (between desired output at 20 dBm and IM3 output at -10 dBm).

But we must first relate this to the **output** Δ, which is given as 30 dB. The gain (G) from input to output is:

\[
G = \text{Desired Output} - \text{Input Tone} = 20 \, \text{dBm} - (-6 \, \text{dBm}) = 26 \, \text{dB}
\]

So, the system has a gain of 26 dB.

Now, the IM3 output is -10 dBm. Since IM3 grows at 3× the input power increase, the IM3 at input would be:

\[
\text{IM3}_{\text{input}} = \text{IM3}_{\text{output}} - G = -10 \, \text{dBm} - 26 \, \text{dB} = -36 \, \text{dBm}
\]

Now, the difference between the desired signal at input (-6 dBm) and the IM3 at input (-36 dBm) is:

\[
\Delta_{\text{in}} = -6 \, \text{dBm} - (-36 \, \text{dBm}) = 30 \, \text{dB}
\]

Wait — same as before! That’s expected: Δ remains the same whether you measure it at input or output when you account for gain.

Now, using the standard formula:

\[
\Delta = 2 \times (\text{IIP3} - \text{Input Power})
\]

Note the sign convention: IIP3 > input power, so:

\[
\Delta = 2 \times (\text{IIP3} - \text{Input}) \Rightarrow
\]

\[
30 = 2 \times (\text{IIP3} - (-6)) \Rightarrow
30 = 2 \times (\text{IIP3} + 6)
\]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[
15 = \text{IIP3} + 6
\Rightarrow \text{IIP3} = 15 - 6 = 9 \, \text{dBm}
\]

✅ Final Answer:
**IIP3 ≈ 9 dBm**",9.0,1.0,0.022987100000000007

s(t) = \cos(\omega_c t + 40 \cos \omega_m t)

This is in the form of a **frequency-modulated (FM)** signal, which generally has the form:

\[
s(t) = \cos\left( \omega_c t + K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau) \, d\tau \right)

- \( \omega_c \) is the carrier angular frequency,
- \( K_{FM} \) is the frequency sensitivity (in rad/(V·s)),
- \( f(t) \) is the modulating signal (voltage),
- The integral of \( f(t) \) gives the phase deviation.

### Step 1: Compare with the given expression

Given:
\[
s(t) = \cos\left( \omega_c t + 40 \cos \omega_m t \right)
\]

This means the phase deviation is:
\[
\phi(t) = 40 \cos \omega_m t
\]

But in FM, the phase deviation is:
\[
\phi(t) = K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau) \, d\tau

"For coherent OOK with equal priors, show the optimal threshold in terms of E_s.","For coherent On-Off Keying (OOK) with equal priors, we want to find the optimal threshold \( \lambda \) that minimizes the probability of error.

---

### **System Model**
In coherent OOK:
- Symbol 0: transmitted signal is \( s_0(t) = 0 \)
- Symbol 1: transmitted signal is \( s_1(t) = \sqrt{E_s} \phi(t) \), where \( \phi(t) \) is a unit-energy pulse and \( E_s \) is the energy per symbol.

Assume:
- Equal prior probabilities: \( P(s_0) = P(s_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN): \( n(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, N_0/2) \)
- Receiver uses matched filter → output at decision time is:
  - If \( s_0 \): \( r = n \)
  - If \( s_1 \): \( r = \sqrt{E_s} + n \)

Let \( r \) be the received scalar after matched filtering (i.e., the observation).

So, the likelihoods are:
- \( p(r|s_0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi N_0}} e^{-r^2 / N_0} \)
- \( p(r|s_1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi N_0}} e^{-(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2 / N_0} \)

---

### **Optimal Threshold Rule**

The optimal detector (MAP) chooses \( s_1 \) if:

\[
p(r|s_1)P(s_1) > p(r|s_0)P(s_0)
\]

Since \( P(s_0) = P(s_1) \), we can drop the priors:

\[
p(r|s_1) > p(r|s_0)
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi N_0}} e^{-(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2 / N_0} > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi N_0}} e^{-r^2 / N_0}
\]

Cancel common terms:

\[
e^{-(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2 / N_0} > e^{-r^2 / N_0}
\]

Take natural log on both sides:

\[
-\frac{(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2}{N_0} > -\frac{r^2}{N_0}
\Rightarrow -(r^2 - 2r\sqrt{E_s} + E_s) > -r^2
\Rightarrow -r^2 + 2r\sqrt{E_s} - E_s > -r^2
\Rightarrow 2r\sqrt{E_s} - E_s > 0

### Step 2: Compute \( e^{\rho^2} \)
\[
e^{0.099856} \approx 1.10507
\]
(You can use a calculator or exponential function; this is approximately \( e^{0.1} \approx 1.10517 \), so 1.10507 is accurate.)

### Step 3: Numerator
\[
e^{\rho^2} - 1 = 1.10507 - 1 = 0.10507
\]

### Step 4: Denominator
First compute \( \sqrt{2\pi} \):
\[
\sqrt{2\pi} \approx \sqrt{6.2832} \approx 2.5066
\]

Now multiply by \( f_D \) and \( \rho \):
\[
\sqrt{2\pi} \cdot f_D \cdot \rho = 2.5066 \times 50 \times 0.316
\]

OFDM clipping. Pr=0.001. Find A0 from exp(-A0^2)=0.001.,"We are given the equation:

\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.001

To solve for \( A_0 \), take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.001)
\]

Now compute \( \ln(0.001) \):

\[
\ln(0.001) = \ln(10^{-3}) = -3 \ln(10) \approx -3 \times 2.3026 = -6.9078

So:

\[
-A_0^2 = -6.9078

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[
A_0^2 = 6.9078

"Shannon capacity. B=8 MHz, SNR=6 dB. Compute C (Mbit/s).","To compute the **Shannon capacity** \( C \) of a communication channel, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 8 \) MHz = \( 8 \times 10^6 \) Hz  
- SNR = 6 dB

First, convert SNR from dB to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{6}{10}} = 10^{0.6} \approx 3.981
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 8 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 3.981) = 8 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(4.981)
\]

Compute \( \log_2(4.981) \):

\[
\log_2(4.981) = \frac{\log_{10}(4.981)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.6973}{0.3010} \approx 2.316

"Required M for target spectral efficiency. With α=0.5, need η=3 bit/s/Hz using η=log2(M)/(1+α). Find M.","We are given:

- Target spectral efficiency: η = 3 bit/s/Hz  
- α = 0.5  
- Formula:  
  $$
  \eta = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1 + \alpha}
  $$

### Step 1: Plug in known values
$$
3 = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1 + 0.5} = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1.5}
$$

### Step 2: Solve for $\log_2(M)$
Multiply both sides by 1.5:
$$
\log_2(M) = 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5
$$

### Step 3: Solve for M
Convert from log base 2:
$$
M = 2^{4.5} = 2^4 \times 2^{0.5} = 16 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 16 \times 1.4142 = 22.627
$$

### Final Answer:
Since M must be an integer (number of constellation points), round to the nearest valid modulation order:

$$
M = 23 \quad \text{(but typically we choose a power of 2 for practical modulation schemes)}
$$

However, if **any M** is acceptable (not necessarily a power of 2), then:

✅ **M ≈ 22.63**

But since M must be an integer and usually corresponds to a standard QAM or PSK size (like 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...), you would need to choose the closest available M such that η ≥ 3.

Let’s check nearby powers of 2:

- M = 16 → log₂(16)/1.5 = 4 / 1.5 = 2.67 < 3 ❌  
- M = 32 → log₂(32)/1.5 = 5 / 1.5 ≈ 3.33 > 3 ✅  

So if only standard modulations allowed, **M = 32** gives η ≈ 3.33 bit/s/Hz, which exceeds the requirement.

### Conclusion:
- Exact value: **M = 2^{4.5} ≈ 22.63**
- Practical choice (if using standard constellations): **M = 32**",32.0,1.0,0.047611750000000015

- SNR = 15 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to a linear scale:

Given:
- \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10 \) dB

First, convert \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) from dB to linear scale:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{10/10} = 10^1 = 10
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{10}\right)

\[
\frac{C}{B} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})

First, compute the product inside:

\[
200 \times 0.5 \times 10^{-3} = 100 \times 10^{-3} = 0.1

Then:

\[
x = 2\pi \times 0.1 = 0.2\pi

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):

\[

- Path loss exponent: γ = 4
- Path loss constant: K = 5.70 × 10⁻⁴
- Noise power: N = 1 × 10⁻²⁰ W
- Single-slope path loss model:  
  \[
  P_r = \frac{P_t}{K \cdot d^\gamma}
  \]

We need to find the distance \( d \) such that:
\[
\frac{P_r}{N} = 100
\]

---

### Step 1: Express Pr from the path loss model
\[
P_r = \frac{P_t}{K \cdot d^\gamma}
\]

Substitute into SNR condition:
\[
\frac{P_r}{N} = \frac{P_t}{K \cdot d^\gamma \cdot N} = 100
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( d \)

\[
\frac{P_t}{K \cdot N \cdot d^\gamma} = 100
\]

Multiply both sides by \( d^\gamma \):
\[
\frac{P_t}{K \cdot N} = 100 \cdot d^\gamma
\]

Now solve for \( d^\gamma \):
\[
d^\gamma = \frac{P_t}{100 \cdot K \cdot N}
\]

Take both sides to the power \( 1/\gamma \):
\[
d = \left( \frac{P_t}{100 \cdot K \cdot N} \right)^{1/\gamma}

- \( N = 1 \times 10^{-20} \) W
- \( \gamma = 4 \)

First compute denominator:
\[
100 \cdot K \cdot N = 100 \cdot (5.70 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot (1 \times 10^{-20}) = 5.70 \times 10^{-22}
\]

Now:
\[
d^4 = \frac{0.01}{5.70 \times 10^{-22}} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-2}}{5.70 \times 10^{-22}} = \frac{1}{5.70} \times 10^{20}
\]

\[
d^4 = 1.754 \times 10^{19}
\]

Now take fourth root:
\[
d = (1.754 \times 10^{19})^{1/4}
\]

Break it down:
\[
= (1.754)^{1/4} \cdot (10^{19})^{1/4} = (1.754)^{0.25} \cdot 10^{4.75}

Compute each part:

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity = 1 Mbit/s = \( 1 \times 10^6 \) bits/sec  
- \( B \) = bandwidth = 200 kHz = \( 200 \times 10^3 \) Hz  
- \( \text{SNR} \) = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

### Step 1: Plug into the formula
\[
1 \times 10^6 = (200 \times 10^3) \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Divide both sides by \( 200 \times 10^3 \):

\[
\frac{10^6}{2 \times 10^5} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

We are asked to find the value of \(\gamma_b\) in dB when \(P_b = 10^{-4}\).

---

### Step 1: Plug in \(P_b = 10^{-4}\)

\[
10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-4} = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = -\frac{\gamma_b}{2}
\]

Compute the left-hand side:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-4}) = \ln(2) - 4\ln(10)
\]

Use approximate values:
- \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\)
- \(\ln(10) \approx 2.3026\)

So:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) \approx 0.6931 - 4 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 9.2104 = -8.5173
\]

Now solve for \(\gamma_b\):

\[
-\frac{\gamma_b}{2} = -8.5173 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma_b = 2 \times 8.5173 = 17.0346
\]

Convert \(\gamma_b\) to dB:

Since \(\gamma_b\) is already a ratio (Eb/N₀), its value in dB is:

\[
\gamma_b \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(\gamma_b) = 10 \log_{10}(17.0346)

Calculate:

\[
\log_{10}(17.0346) \approx 1.2313

### Step 1: Convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{18/10} = 10^{1.8} \approx 63.0957
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute constants

- \( \log_2 64 = 6 \) (since \( 2^6 = 64 \))
- \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \)

So the coefficients become:
\[
\frac{4}{6} \left(1 - \frac{1}{8}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{8} = \frac{14}{24} = \frac{7}{12}
\]

Now, the argument of the Q-function:
\[
\sqrt{ \frac{3 \cdot 6}{63} \cdot 63.0957 } = \sqrt{ \frac{18}{63} \cdot 63.0957 }

Simplify:
\[
\frac{18}{63} = \frac{6}{21} = \frac{2}{7} \approx 0.2857

Then:
\[
\sqrt{0.2857 \cdot 63.0957} \approx \sqrt{17.999} \approx \sqrt{18} \approx 4.2426

✅ So the Q-function argument is approximately \( 4.24 \)

- \( x^2 = 18 \)
- \( e^{-9} \approx 1.234 \times 10^{-4} \)
- \( \frac{1}{x \sqrt{2\pi}} = \frac{1}{4.24 \cdot \sqrt{6.283}} \approx \frac{1}{4.24 \cdot 2.507} \approx \frac{1}{10.63} \approx 0.094 \)

Then:
\[
Q(4.24) \approx 0.094 \cdot 1.234 \times 10^{-4} \approx 1.16 \times 10^{-5}

E1: bits/frame=256 and frame rate=8 kHz. Confirm line rate.,"To confirm the line rate, we need to calculate how many bits are transmitted per second (bit rate), and then determine the line rate based on that.

Given:
- Bits per frame = 256
- Frame rate = 8 kHz = 8000 frames per second

Step 1: Calculate bit rate (bits per second):
\[
\text{Bit rate} = \text{bits/frame} \times \text{frame rate}
= 256 \times 8000 = 2,048,000 \text{ bits per second}
\]

This is also known as 2.048 Mbps (Megabits per second).

Step 2: Line rate
In digital communications, ""line rate"" typically refers to the actual transmission rate over the physical medium—this may include overhead like framing bits, synchronization bits, or error correction codes.

However, in this context—if no additional overhead is mentioned—the **line rate equals the bit rate**.

✅ So, the line rate is:
\[
\boxed{2.048 \text{ Mbps}}
\]

If you're working with a specific encoding scheme (like T1, E1, etc.), there might be slight differences due to framing overhead—but since the question gives only bits/frame and frame rate, we assume no extra overhead.

Therefore, the confirmed line rate is **2.048 Mbps**.",2048000.0,1.0,0.04205510000000001

"Inserted-pilot carrier recovery: LPF output is S_LPF(t)=A/2[m(t)+1]. If m(t) has mean 0.2, find the DC component.","We are given the low-pass filter (LPF) output:

\[
S_{\text{LPF}}(t) = \frac{A}{2}[m(t) + 1]
\]

and told that \( m(t) \) has a mean of 0.2.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is being asked
The **DC component** of a signal is its average value over time — i.e., the constant (time-independent) part of the signal.

So, we need to find the **average value** of \( S_{\text{LPF}}(t) \).

---

### Step 2: Use linearity of expectation (average)
The average of a linear expression is the same linear expression of the averages:

\[
\mathbb{E}[S_{\text{LPF}}(t)] = \frac{A}{2} \left[ \mathbb{E}[m(t)] + 1 \right]
\]

Given:
\[
\mathbb{E}[m(t)] = 0.2
\]

So plug in:

\[
\mathbb{E}[S_{\text{LPF}}(t)] = \frac{A}{2} (0.2 + 1) = \frac{A}{2} \times 1.2 = \frac{1.2A}{2} = 0.6A
\]

Union-bound term threshold for QPSK. Want Q(\sqrt{4E_b/N_0})<10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 (dB).,"We are given a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) system and want the bit error rate (BER) to be less than \( 10^{-6} \). For QPSK, the BER in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

But wait — **there's a common confusion here**. In some references, especially when comparing with BPSK, people may write the QPSK BER as:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

This form arises if you define \( E_b \) as the energy per **bit**, and the signal constellation uses two bits per symbol (since QPSK has 4 symbols), so the total energy per symbol is \( 2E_b \). Then, for QPSK, each symbol carries 2 bits, and the average energy per symbol \( E_s = 2E_b \). The distance between adjacent points in QPSK is \( \sqrt{2E_s} = \sqrt{4E_b} \). So, the standard expression for QPSK BER is indeed:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

However, your problem states:

> Want \( Q\left( \sqrt{4E_b/N_0} \right) < 10^{-6} \)

So it seems you're using a formulation where the argument of the Q-function is \( \sqrt{4E_b/N_0} \). This is equivalent to saying that the BER equals \( Q(\sqrt{4E_b/N_0}) \), which would imply that the effective SNR per bit used in the Q-function is scaled differently.

Let’s proceed assuming this form is correct for your context — perhaps because you’re equating it to a bound or using a different normalization. So we set:

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} \right) < 10^{-6}
\]

We solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \), then convert to dB.

---

### Step 1: Solve for the argument

Set:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 10^{-6}
\]

Invert the Q-function:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(10^{-6})
\]

From standard Q-function tables or approximations:

\[
Q^{-1}(10^{-6}) \approx 4.753
\]

(Since \( Q(4.753) \approx 10^{-6} \))

So:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} = 4.753
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{4E_b}{N_0} = (4.753)^2 \approx 22.59
\]

Then:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{22.59}{4} = 5.6475
\]

Now convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0}\text{(dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(5.6475) \approx 10 \times 0.7518 \approx 7.52 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{7.52 \, \text{dB}}

Compute orthogonal Δf for R_b=1200 bit/s.,"To compute the orthogonal Δf (frequency separation) for a given bit rate \( R_b = 1200 \) bit/s, we typically refer to **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)** or **Minimum Shift Keying (MSK)**-like principles where symbols are orthogonal over a symbol period.

However, in many contexts — especially with M-ary orthogonal signaling (e.g., in spread-spectrum or some digital modulation schemes) — the minimum frequency separation for orthogonality between adjacent tones or symbols is:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{R_b}{N}
\]

But if you're asking about the **minimum frequency separation** for two signals to be orthogonal in time-limited scenarios (as in classical digital communications), such as in **Binary Orthogonal Signaling**, the condition for orthogonality over one symbol duration \( T_s \) is:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{1}{T_s}
\]

Given that:
- \( R_b = 1200 \) bits per second ⇒ symbol duration \( T_s = \frac{1}{R_b} = \frac{1}{1200} \) seconds

Then, for orthogonality of two sinusoidal waveforms (say, for binary orthogonal FSK), the minimum frequency separation required is:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{1}{T_s} = R_b
\]

So,

\[
\Delta f = 1200 \text{ Hz}
\]

✅ Final Answer:
\[
\Delta f = 1200 \text{ Hz}
\]

This is the standard result when using binary orthogonal FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) with coherent detection and symbol duration \( T_s = 1/R_b \).",600.0,0.0,0.012163349999999996

\]

and asked to compute \( p_b \) when \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10 \, \text{dB} \).

---

### Step 1: Convert dB to linear scale
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{10/10} = 10
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( \sin(\pi/8) \)

\[
\frac{\pi}{8} = 22.5^\circ \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \sin(22.5^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2} \approx 0.3827
\]

(You can also use a calculator: \( \sin(22.5^\circ) \approx 0.382683 \))

---

### Step 3: Plug into the formula

First, compute the argument of the Q-function:

\[
\sqrt{6 \cdot 10} \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \sqrt{60} \cdot 0.382683
\]

\[
\sqrt{60} \approx 7.746 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 7.746 \times 0.382683 \approx 2.965
\]

So we have:
\[
p_b \approx \frac{2}{3} Q(2.965)
\]

---

### Step 4: Evaluate the Q-function

The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

Use an approximation or standard table. For \( x = 2.965 \):

From Q-function tables or using Python/scipy:

\[
Q(2.965) \approx 0.00151

(Since \( Q(3) \approx 0.00135 \), and \( Q(2.965) \) is slightly larger — this value is reasonable.)

Alternatively, use a more precise value from numerical computation:

\[
Q(2.965) \approx 0.001514

Outage strategy optimization (discrete). Same states as previous. Compare outage capacity for γ_min=3.162 vs γ_min=1 and pick larger. Provide both values.,"To optimize the outage strategy for discrete states and compare outage capacities at two different minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) thresholds — γ_min = 3.162 and γ_min = 1 — we need to evaluate the outage capacity under each threshold and then select the larger value.

Assuming the system has a finite set of discrete channel states (e.g., indexed by i), each with an SNR γ_i, and that outage occurs when γ_i < γ_min, the outage capacity is given by:

\[
C_{\text{out}} = \sum_{i: \gamma_i \geq \gamma_{\min}} p_i \log_2(1 + \gamma_i)
\]

Where:
- \( p_i \) is the probability of being in state \( i \),
- The sum is over all states where the SNR meets or exceeds the threshold \( \gamma_{\min} \).

Since the problem refers to ""same states as previous"" but does not specify them, I’ll assume a typical setup from prior problems (e.g., three discrete states with SNRs and probabilities):

Example (from common textbook setups):
- State 1: γ₁ = 1 dB ⇒ γ₁ ≈ 1.2589, p₁ = 0.3
- State 2: γ₂ = 4 dB ⇒ γ₂ ≈ 2.5119, p₂ = 0.4
- State 3: γ₃ = 10 dB ⇒ γ₃ ≈ 10.0000, p₃ = 0.3

Let’s compute outage capacity for both γ_min values:

---

**Case 1: γ_min = 3.162**
- Convert to linear scale: γ_min = 3.162 (this is 5 dB).
- Check which states satisfy γ_i ≥ 3.162:
  - γ₁ = 1.2589 < 3.162 → Outage → excluded
  - γ₂ = 2.5119 < 3.162 → Outage → excluded
  - γ₃ = 10.0000 ≥ 3.162 → Included
- Only state 3 contributes:
  \[
  C_{\text{out}}^{(3.162)} = p_3 \log_2(1 + \gamma_3) = 0.3 \cdot \log_2(1 + 10) = 0.3 \cdot \log_2(11) \approx 0.3 \cdot 3.4594 = 1.0378 \text{ bits/s/Hz}
  \]

---

**Case 2: γ_min = 1**
- Convert γ_min = 1 (linear, 0 dB).
- All states have γ_i ≥ 1:
  - γ₁ = 1.2589 ≥ 1 → included
  - γ₂ = 2.5119 ≥ 1 → included
  - γ₃ = 10 ≥ 1 → included
- Full sum:
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(1)} = p_1 \log_2(1+γ_1) + p_2 \log_2(1+γ_2) + p_3 \log_2(1+γ_3)
\]
Compute each term:
- \( \log_2(1 + 1.2589) = \log_2(2.2589) \approx 1.170 \)
- \( \log_2(1 + 2.5119) = \log_2(3.5119) \approx 1.825 \)
- \( \log_2(1 + 10) = \log_2(11) \approx 3.459 \)

Now:
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(1)} = 0.3 \cdot 1.170 + 0.4 \cdot 1.825 + 0.3 \cdot 3.459 \\
= 0.351 + 0.730 + 1.0377 = 2.1187 \text{ bits/s/Hz}

Solving for \( R_s \):

- Threshold power: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \) dBm  
- Standard deviation of log-normal fading: \( \sigma = 12 \) dB  
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 1\% = 0.01 \)

This is a classic problem in wireless communications where the received power follows a **log-normal distribution**. The outage occurs when the received power falls below the threshold.

---

### Step 1: Define the Log-Normal Distribution

Let \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), so the received power in dBm is:
\[
P_{\text{rx}} = 10^{\frac{X}{10}} \quad \text{(in mW)}
\]
But since we work in dBm, it's easier to model the received power directly as a Gaussian random variable in dBm:

Let \( Y \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), representing the received power in dBm.

Outage occurs when \( Y < P_{\text{th}} = 10 \) dBm.

So:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(Y < 10) = \Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the standard normal CDF.

Set this equal to 0.01:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{12} \right) = 0.01

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \mu \)

Find the z-score corresponding to \( \Phi(z) = 0.01 \):

From standard normal tables or using a calculator:
\[
z = \Phi^{-1}(0.01) \approx -2.326

Now solve:

\frac{10 - \mu}{12} = -2.326

  P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
  \]

---

### Step 1: Convert \( P_r \) from dBm to watts

\[
P_r = 10^{-60/10} \, \text{mW} = 10^{-6} \, \text{mW} = 10^{-9} \, \text{W}
\]

So:
\[
P_r = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find wavelength \( \lambda \)

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}} = 0.15 \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Step 3: Plug into the formula and solve for \( P_t \)

\[
P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
\]

Solve for \( P_t \):

\[
P_t = P_r \left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)^2
\]

Substitute values:

\[
\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} = \frac{4\pi \cdot 50}{0.15} = \frac{200\pi}{0.15} = \frac{200 \cdot 3.1416}{0.15} \approx \frac{628.32}{0.15} \approx 4188.8
\]

Now square it:

\[
\left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)^2 \approx (4188.8)^2 \approx 17,546,300
\]

Now compute \( P_t \):

\[
P_t = 10^{-9} \times 17,546,300 \approx 1.75463 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{W}
\]

---

"Log-normal outage. Mean μ=15 dBm, σ=8 dB, threshold 5 dBm. Compute outage probability.","To compute the **outage probability** for a log-normal fading channel, we follow these steps:

---

### Given:
- **Received signal power** follows a **log-normal distribution**.
- Mean of the **logarithm of the power (in dB)**:  
  \( \mu = 15 \) dBm
- Standard deviation of the logarithm:  
  \( \sigma = 8 \) dB
- **Threshold**:  
  \( P_{\text{th}} = 5 \) dBm

Outage occurs when the received power drops **below the threshold**, i.e.,  
\( P < P_{\text{th}} \)

Since the received power is log-normally distributed, its logarithm (in dB) is normally distributed:
\[
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

The outage probability is:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(X < P_{\text{th}})
= \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

---

### Plug in values:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{5 - 15}{8} \right)
= \Phi\left( \frac{-10}{8} \right)
= \Phi(-1.25)
\]

From standard normal tables or using a calculator:
\[
\Phi(-1.25) = 1 - \Phi(1.25) \approx 1 - 0.8944 = 0.1056
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{P_{\text{out}} = 0.1056}
\]

So, the outage probability is approximately **10.56%**.",0.106,0.0,0.01841555
A maximal-length LFSR has period 1023. Find degree n.,"We are told that a maximal-length Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) has a period of 1023, and we are to find the degree \( n \).

### Key Concept:
For a maximal-length LFSR with feedback polynomial of degree \( n \), the maximum possible period is:

\[
\text{Period} = 2^n - 1
\]

This occurs when the feedback polynomial is **primitive** (i.e., it generates a maximal-length sequence).

So, we solve:

\[
2^n - 1 = 1023
\]

Add 1 to both sides:

\[
2^n = 1024
\]

Now, recognize that:

\[
1024 = 2^{10}
\]

Therefore:

\[
n = 10

"Coherent 16-QAM union-bound inversion. For p_b=10^{-3}, estimate required E_b/N_0 in dB using p_b≈(3/4)Q(\sqrt{(4/5)\gamma_b}).","We are asked to estimate the required \( E_b/N_0 \) in dB for a 16-QAM system, given a bit error probability \( p_b = 10^{-3} \), using the approximation:

\[
p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right)
\]

where \( \gamma_b = E_b/N_0 \).

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation
We want to solve for \( \gamma_b \) such that:
\[
\frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right) = 10^{-3}
\]

Divide both sides by \( \frac{3}{4} \):
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{4}{3000} = \frac{1}{750}
\]

So we now have:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right) = \frac{1}{750}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{750}
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \) using inverse Q-function

We need the inverse Q-function:  
\( x = Q^{-1}(1/750) \)

From standard Q-function tables or using approximations:

- \( Q(3.09) \approx 0.001 \) (i.e., \( 10^{-3} \))
- More precisely, \( Q(3.089) \approx 0.001 \)

But here we have \( Q(x) = 1/750 \approx 0.001333 \)

So we need a slightly smaller \( x \) than 3.09.

Use linear approximation or known values:

- \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.0013499 \) → very close!
- \( Q(3.0) \approx 1.3499 \times 10^{-3} \approx 1/740 \)

So:
\[
x \approx 3.0
\]

(Actually, \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.0013499 \), and \( 1/750 = 0.001333... \), so \( x \approx 3.0 \) is quite accurate.)

More precisely, let’s use the inverse Q-function value for \( 1/750 \):

Using a more precise method (or MATLAB/Python `scipy.stats.norm.ppf`):

The inverse of the Q-function at 1/750 is:
\[
x = Q^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{750} \right) \approx 3.000
\]

(Since \( Q(3.0) \approx 0.0013499 \approx 0.001333 \) is off by about 1%, but acceptable for estimation.)

Alternatively, use:
\[
x \approx 3.00
\]

Now plug back into:

\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} = 3.0
\]

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b = 9
\Rightarrow \gamma_b = \frac{9 \cdot 5}{4} = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25
\]

---

### Step 3: Convert to dB

\[
E_b/N_0 = \gamma_b = 11.25 \text{ (linear)}
\]
\[
E_b/N_0 \text{ in dB} = 10 \log_{10}(11.25) \approx 10 \times 1.0512 \approx 10.51 \text{ dB}

- \( E_b/N_0 \) is the energy-per-bit to noise-power-spectral-density ratio.

Given:  
\( P_b = 0.01 \)

We need to solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \):

\[
0.01 = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]

From Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q(2.326) \approx 0.01
\]

So:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 2.326
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (2.326)^2 \approx 5.41
\]

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5.41}{2} \approx 2.705

### Step 1: Plug in \( n = 40 \)

\[
P_f \approx (1 + 40) \cdot 2^{-40} = 41 \cdot 2^{-40}
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( 2^{-40} \)

We know:
\[
2^{10} = 1024 \approx 10^3
\]
So:
\[
2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 \approx (10^3)^4 = 10^{12}

Thus:
\[
2^{-40} \approx 10^{-12}
\]

More precisely, using exact value:
\[
2^{40} = 1,\!099,\!511,\!627,\!776

So:
\[
2^{-40} = \frac{1}{1,\!099,\!511,\!627,\!776} \approx 9.094947 \times 10^{-13}

- Number of levels: \( M = 64 \)
- Formula for SQNR in decibels:  
  \[
  \text{SQNR(dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(M)

### Step-by-step calculation:

\[
\text{SQNR(dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(64)
\]

First, compute \( \log_{10}(64) \):

Note that:
\[
64 = 2^6 \Rightarrow \log_{10}(64) = \log_{10}(2^6) = 6 \log_{10}(2)

We know:
\[
\log_{10}(2) \approx 0.3010

- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3400 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 20 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 3400 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 3400 \times \log_2(101)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(101) \):

\[
\log_2(101) = \frac{\log_{10}(101)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{2.0043}{0.3010} \approx 6.658

### Step 1: Convert E_b/N_0 from dB to linear scale

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{14/10} = 10^{1.4} \approx 25.1189
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the argument of the Q-function

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \cdot 25.1189} = \sqrt{20.0951} \approx 4.483

- Modulation: 8PSK  
- η = 0.5 log₂(M) — this is a key relationship, likely relating to spectral efficiency  

We are to find the **maximum bit rate** (R_b).

### Step 1: Understand the parameters

- 8PSK means M = 8 (8 symbols per constellation).
- So, each symbol carries:
  \[
  \log_2(8) = 3 \text{ bits per symbol}
  \]

- The formula for spectral efficiency (η) is typically:

- Modulating tone frequency: \( f_m = 4 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Efficiency: \( \eta = 0.25 \)

### Step 1: Calculate Noise Power at Input \( N_i \)

For a baseband (tone) modulation, the input noise power is:
\[
N_i = n_0 \cdot 2f_m
\]
\[
N_i = (2 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 2 \cdot (4 \times 10^3) = (2 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 8 \times 10^3 = 16 \times 10^{-7} = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{W}

Use the efficiency formula:
\[
\eta = \frac{\beta^2}{2 + \beta^2}
\]
Solve for \( \beta^2 \):
\[
\eta(2 + \beta^2) = \beta^2 \\
2\eta + \eta\beta^2 = \beta^2 \\
2\eta = \beta^2 - \eta\beta^2 = \beta^2(1 - \eta) \\
\Rightarrow \beta^2 = \frac{2\eta}{1 - \eta}

Plug in \( \eta = 0.25 \):
\[
\beta^2 = \frac{2 \cdot 0.25}{1 - 0.25} = \frac{0.5}{0.75} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate AM System Gain \( G_{AM} \)

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{2\beta^2}{2 + \beta^2}
\]
Substitute \( \beta^2 = \frac{2}{3} \):
\[
G_{AM} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2}{3}}{2 + \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}}{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5

"QPSK in same bandwidth. If baseband B=44.8 kHz and α=0.4, find maximum QPSK bit rate (use B=(1+α)R_s/2, R_b=2R_s).","We are given:

- Baseband bandwidth \( B = 44.8 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.4 \)  
- QPSK modulation:  
  - Symbol rate \( R_s \) (baud rate)  
  - Bit rate \( R_b = 2R_s \) (since each symbol carries 2 bits)

The formula for the required bandwidth in baseband for a raised cosine filter is:

\[
B = \frac{(1 + \alpha) R_s}{2}
\]

We need to solve for \( R_s \), then compute \( R_b = 2R_s \).

---

### Step 1: Solve for \( R_s \)

From the bandwidth formula:
\[
B = \frac{(1 + \alpha) R_s}{2}
\]

Plug in known values:
\[
44.8 \times 10^3 = \frac{(1 + 0.4) R_s}{2}

Coherent BPSK with carrier phase offset φ. Decision statistic means are ±A cosφ. What is optimal decision threshold (equal priors)?,"For Coherent BPSK with a carrier phase offset \( \phi \), the decision statistic at the receiver has:

- Mean \( +A \cos\phi \) when bit 1 is transmitted
- Mean \( -A \cos\phi \) when bit 0 is transmitted

Assuming **equal priors** (i.e., P(0) = P(1) = 0.5), the optimal decision threshold for minimizing the probability of error is the **midpoint between the two means**.

### Optimal Decision Threshold:
\[
\boxed{0}
\]

### Explanation:
The two conditional probability density functions (PDFs) are symmetric around their respective means \( \pm A \cos\phi \). Since the priors are equal, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) rule reduces to the maximum likelihood (ML) rule, and the optimal threshold is the point where the two PDFs cross — which is exactly halfway between the two means:

\[
\text{Threshold} = \frac{A \cos\phi + (-A \cos\phi)}{2} = 0

### Step 1: BER for coherent 2ASK

The bit error rate (BER) for coherent 2ASK is:
\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Note: This is because in 2ASK, the distance between signal points is \( \sqrt{2E_b} \), so the SNR per bit is \( \frac{2E_b}{N_0} \).

Given:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{E_b/N_0} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 0.02
\]

Calculate:
\[
\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142 \Rightarrow \sqrt{2} \cdot 0.02 \approx 0.028284

So:
\[

### Step 2: Use the given approximation

Use:

First, compute \( \sqrt{2\pi} \approx \sqrt{6.2832} \approx 2.5066 \)

Note: Since \( E_b \) is in joules (J), and \( N_0 \) is in watts per hertz (W/Hz), their ratio is dimensionless, as required.

"Water-filling normalized power allocation. Cutoff γ_0=0.8. For state γ=0.5, compute S(γ)/S.","To compute \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) under water-filling normalized power allocation with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \) and state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), we proceed as follows:

---

### Step 1: Understand Water-Filling Power Allocation

In water-filling, the optimal power allocation for a channel with gain \( \gamma \) is:

\[
P(\gamma) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\mu} - \frac{1}{\gamma}, & \text{if } \gamma > \gamma_0 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

where:
- \( \mu \) is the water level (chosen such that total power is normalized),
- \( \gamma_0 \) is the cutoff threshold (here, \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \)),
- The average power \( S \) is fixed (say, \( S = 1 \)) — this normalization implies we're working in units where total power per symbol is 1.

But in the question, it asks for \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \), where:
- \( S(\gamma) \) is the **power allocated to channel state \( \gamma \)**,
- \( S \) is the total average power (usually normalized to 1).

So we want the normalized power allocated to the specific state \( \gamma = 0.5 \) when using water-filling with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \).

---

### Step 2: Apply Water-Filling Rule

Given \( \gamma = 0.5 < \gamma_0 = 0.8 \),  
→ The water-filling rule says: **no power is allocated to this state**.

So:

\[
P(\gamma) = 0 \quad \text{for } \gamma = 0.5
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0}{S} = 0
\]

(We assume \( S = 1 \) for normalization.)

"Compute required modulation order. In same channel (B=4 kHz, α=0.5), need R_b=16 kbit/s. What minimum M (power of 2) is needed?","We are given:

- Channel bandwidth \( B = 4 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.5 \)  
- Required bit rate \( R_b = 16 \) kbit/s  

We are to find the **minimum modulation order \( M \)** (a power of 2) that satisfies this requirement.

---

### Step 1: Compute Maximum Spectral Efficiency
The maximum spectral efficiency \( \eta \) for a system with roll-off \( \alpha \) is:

\[
\eta = \frac{R_b}{B(1 + \alpha)} \quad \text{(in bits/second/Hz)}
\]

But since we want to **find the required \( M \)**, it's better to use the relationship between \( M \) and \( R_b \):

In QAM or MPSK, the number of bits per symbol is:
\[
\log_2(M)
\]

If we assume ideal Nyquist signaling (no ISI), the symbol rate \( R_s \) must satisfy:
\[
R_s \leq \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Then the bit rate is:
\[
R_b = R_s \cdot \log_2(M)
\]

So, the maximum possible \( R_b \) for a given \( M \) is:
\[
R_b^{\text{max}} = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2(M)
\]

Set this equal to the required \( R_b = 16 \) kbit/s to find the minimum \( M \):

\[
\frac{2B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2(M) \geq R_b
\]

Plug in values:

- \( B = 4 \times 10^3 \) Hz  
- \( \alpha = 0.5 \) → \( 1 + \alpha = 1.5 \)  
- \( R_b = 16 \times 10^3 \) bit/s  

So:

\[
\frac{2 \times 4000}{1.5} \cdot \log_2(M) \geq 16000
\]
\[
\frac{8000}{1.5} \cdot \log_2(M) \geq 16000
\]
\[
5333.\overline{3} \cdot \log_2(M) \geq 16000
\]

Divide both sides:

\[
\log_2(M) \geq \frac{16000}{5333.\overline{3}} = 3
\]

So:
\[
\log_2(M) \geq 3 \Rightarrow M \geq 2^3 = 8
\]

Now check if \( M = 8 \) is sufficient:

- With \( M = 8 \), each symbol carries \( \log_2(8) = 3 \) bits  
- Max symbol rate: \( R_s = \frac{2B}{1+\alpha} = \frac{8000}{1.5} = 5333.\overline{3} \) symbols/sec  
- Max bit rate: \( 5333.\overline{3} \times 3 = 16000 \) kbit/s → exactly meets requirement

### Step 1: Set up the inequality
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2}} < 0.3

Take reciprocal of both sides (note inequality flips since both sides positive):
\[
\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2} > \frac{1}{0.3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.333...
\]

Now square both sides:
\[
1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2 > \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{100}{9}

Subtract 1:
\[

\]

Solve for Δf:
\[
\Delta f > \frac{\sqrt{91}}{3 \cdot 2\pi \tau_{\text{rms}}} = \frac{\sqrt{91}}{6\pi \tau_{\text{rms}}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug in numbers

- \(\sqrt{91} \approx 9.539\)
- \(\pi \approx 3.1416\)
- \(\tau_{\text{rms}} = 10^{-6}\) s

So:
\[
\Delta f > \frac{9.539}{6 \times 3.1416 \times 10^{-6}} = \frac{9.539}{18.8496 \times 10^{-6}} \approx \frac{9.539}{1.88496 \times 10^{-5}}

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\Delta f > 506 \, \text{kHz}

"A cubic amplifier two-tone test: at input -10 dBm, desired output 15 dBm and IM3 output -25 dBm. Estimate IIP3.","To estimate the Third-Order Intercept Point (IIP3) from a two-tone test, we use the relationship between the fundamental output power, the third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3), and the IIP3.

### Given:
- Input power (P_in) = -10 dBm  
- Desired output power (P_out) = 15 dBm  
- IM3 output power (P_IM3) = -25 dBm  

We assume the amplifier has a linear gain G, so:

\[
G = P_{out} - P_{in} = 15 \text{ dBm} - (-10 \text{ dBm}) = 25 \text{ dB}
\]

Now, for a two-tone test, the relationship between the fundamental and the IM3 is:

\[
P_{IM3} = 3 \cdot P_{in} - 2 \cdot IIP3
\]

This is derived from the fact that the IM3 grows at 3× the rate of the fundamentals — hence, the slope of IM3 vs. input is 3:1 in dB.

So rearranging to solve for IIP3:

\[
IIP3 = \frac{3 \cdot P_{in} - P_{IM3}}{2}
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
IIP3 = \frac{3 \cdot (-10) - (-25)}{2} = \frac{-30 + 25}{2} = \frac{-5}{2} = -2.5 \text{ dBm}
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:

"Uniform quantizer: range -2 to +2 V, n=8 bits, endpoints included. Find step size Δ.","To find the step size Δ of a uniform quantizer:

Given:
- Range: from -2 V to +2 V
- Number of bits: n = 8
- Endpoints are included

### Step 1: Determine the total number of quantization levels
For an n-bit uniform quantizer, the number of levels is:
\[
L = 2^n = 2^8 = 256
\]

### Step 2: Compute the total range
The total range is:
\[
\text{Range} = 2 - (-2) = 4 \text{ V}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate step size Δ
The step size is the total range divided by the number of intervals between levels.

Note: With L levels, there are (L - 1) intervals if endpoints are included and quantization is uniform. But in standard uniform quantization with endpoints included and equal spacing, we typically divide the full range into L equal steps. This includes both endpoints.

So, for a uniform quantizer with L levels (including both endpoints), the step size is:

"E1: if TS0 is framing and TS16 is signaling, how many user voice channels remain?","To determine how many user voice channels remain, we need to understand the context — this appears to relate to **T1 framing** in telecommunications (e.g., DS1).

In a standard **T1 line**:

- There are **24 time slots (TS)** per frame.
- Each time slot carries **64 kbps** of data (typically for one voice channel).
- One additional time slot is used for framing and synchronization.

So:

Matched filter for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Find h(t)=s(T-t).,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

This is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = T/3 \). The unit step function \( U(t) \) ensures the pulse is zero for \( t < 0 \) and \( t > T/3 \).

---

### Goal:
Find the matched filter impulse response:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

This means we need to **time-reverse** the signal \( s(t) \) and shift it by \( T \).

Let’s proceed step-by-step.

---

### Step 1: Understand \( s(t) \)

The signal \( s(t) \) is:

- \( s(t) = A \) for \( 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{3} \)
- \( s(t) = 0 \) otherwise

So, it's a rectangular pulse from 0 to \( T/3 \).

---

### Step 2: Compute \( h(t) = s(T - t) \)

Let’s define a new variable \( \tau = T - t \), so that \( s(T - t) = s(\tau) \).

Now, express \( h(t) = s(T - t) \). This is the time-reversed and shifted version of \( s(t) \):

To find when \( h(t) \neq 0 \), determine when \( T - t \in [0, T/3] \), because \( s(\tau) \neq 0 \) only when \( 0 \leq \tau \leq T/3 \).

So set:

\[
0 \leq T - t \leq \frac{T}{3}
\]

Solve the inequality:

- Left: \( T - t \geq 0 \Rightarrow t \leq T \)
- Right: \( T - t \leq \frac{T}{3} \Rightarrow t \geq T - \frac{T}{3} = \frac{2T}{3} \)

Therefore, \( h(t) \neq 0 \) when \( \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \)

And in this interval, since \( s(T - t) = A \), we have:

\[
h(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

---

### Final Answer:

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(t - \tfrac{2T}{3}) - U(t - T) \right]
\]

This is a rectangular pulse of height \( A \), starting at \( t = \frac{2T}{3} \) and ending at \( t = T \). It is the time-reversed (and delayed) version of \( s(t) \), as required for a matched filter.",h(t)=A[U(t-2T/3)-U(t-T)],1.0,0.03645175

"Write the FM signal expression for A_c=6 V, f_c=1 MHz, f_m=5 kHz, A_m=2 V, K_FM=4 kHz/V.","The expression for an FM (Frequency Modulation) signal is given by:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + 2\pi K_{FM} \int_0^t m(\tau) \, d\tau \right)
\]

Where:
- \( A_c = 6 \) V (carrier amplitude),
- \( f_c = 1 \) MHz (carrier frequency),
- \( f_m = 5 \) kHz (modulating signal frequency),
- \( A_m = 2 \) V (amplitude of the modulating signal),
- \( K_{FM} = 4 \) kHz/V (frequency sensitivity).

Assume the modulating signal is a sinusoid:
\[
m(t) = A_m \cos(2\pi f_m t) = 2 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5000 \cdot t)
\]

Now compute the integral:
\[
\int_0^t m(\tau) \, d\tau = \int_0^t 2 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5000 \cdot \tau) \, d\tau
= \frac{2}{2\pi \cdot 5000} \sin(2\pi \cdot 5000 \cdot t)
= \frac{1}{5000\pi} \sin(2\pi \cdot 5000 \cdot t)

Now plug into the FM expression:
\[
s(t) = 6 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 10^6 t + 2\pi \cdot 4000 \cdot \frac{1}{5000\pi} \sin(2\pi \cdot 5000 \cdot t) \right)

Simplify the phase deviation term:
\[
2\pi \cdot 4000 \cdot \frac{1}{5000\pi} = \frac{8000\pi}{5000\pi} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6

So, the final FM signal expression is:

\[

"If synchronized to the second path (50 ns) for same delays {0,50,120} ns, find T_m.","To find \( T_m \) (the minimum time required for synchronization), we need to understand what is meant by ""synchronized to the second path"" and how delays {0, 50, 120} ns relate.

Given:
- Delays: {0, 50, 120} ns
- Synchronized to the **second path** (which has a delay of 50 ns)
- The term ""same delays"" suggests that all paths have the same delay values relative to each other — so one path has 0 ns delay, another 50 ns, and another 120 ns.

The phrase ""synchronized to the second path (50 ns)"" likely means that we are aligning all signals to arrive at the same time as the signal with 50 ns delay — i.e., we want all signals to be delayed such that their arrival times match the timing of the 50 ns path.

So, to synchronize:
- Signal with 0 ns delay → must be delayed by 50 ns
- Signal with 50 ns delay → no delay needed
- Signal with 120 ns delay → must be delayed by 70 ns (to reduce its delay from 120 to 50)

The total time required for this synchronization (i.e., the maximum delay applied to any signal) is:

\[
T_m = \max(50, 0, 70) = 70 \text{ ns}

\]

We are asked to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB when \( P_b = 10^{-3} \).

---

### Step 1: Solve for \( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \)

Set:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-3}
\]

This implies:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(10^{-3})
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q^{-1}(10^{-3}) \approx 3.09
\]

(You can verify this using standard normal distribution tables or functions like `norminv` in MATLAB or Python's `scipy.stats.norm.ppf`.)

So:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = 3.09
\]

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = (3.09)^2 = 9.5481

- Target BER (Bit Error Rate) for DBPSK:  
  \( P_b = 10^{-4} \)

- Bit rate:  
  \( R_b = 1 \, \text{Mbit/s} = 10^6 \, \text{bits/s} \)

- One-sided noise power spectral density:  
  \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

- DBPSK error probability formula:  
  \( P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0} \)

We are to find the required received power \( P_r \).

---

### Step 1: Solve for \( E_b / N_0 \)

From the DBPSK BER formula:
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Solve for \( E_b / N_0 \):

\[
10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
2 \times 10^{-4} = e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = -\frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

Compute the left-hand side:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-4}) = \ln(2) - 4 \ln(10)
\]
\[
\approx 0.6931 - 4 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 9.2104 = -8.5173
\]

So:
\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = -8.5173 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 8.5173
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( E_b \)

\( E_b \) is the energy per bit:
\[
E_b = R_b \cdot P_r
\]

But we need \( P_r \), so let’s express it using \( E_b/N_0 \):
\[
E_b = \left(\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right) \cdot N_0 = 8.5173 \times 2 \times 10^{-20}
\]
\[
E_b = 1.70346 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{Joules}
\]

Now recall:
\[
E_b = R_b \cdot P_r \Rightarrow P_r = \frac{E_b}{R_b}
\]

Plug in values:
\[
P_r = \frac{1.70346 \times 10^{-19}}{10^6} = 1.70346 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{W}

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bit/s)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- \( \text{SNR} \) = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- \( C = 20 \, \text{kbit/s} = 20,000 \, \text{bit/s} \)
- \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3400 \, \text{Hz} \)

We need to solve for SNR.

---

### Step 1: Plug into Shannon's formula

\[
20,000 = 3400 \cdot \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Divide both sides by 3400:

\[
\frac{20,000}{3400} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

\[
5.8824 \approx \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

---

### Step 2: Convert from log base 2 to linear

\[
1 + \text{SNR} = 2^{5.8824}
\]

Calculate the exponent:

\[
2^{5.8824} \approx 56.23

"For the same amplifier, what is the output power when IM3 equals desired?","When the third-order intercept point (IP3 or IM3) is equal to the desired signal power level, it means that the amplifier is operating at a point where the **third-order intermodulation distortion (IMD3)** products are equal in magnitude to the desired fundamental signal.

This condition typically occurs when:
- The input signal power is such that the nonlinear distortion products (IM3) are not yet saturated but have grown to match the desired signal power.
- It's often used as a reference point for linearity performance.

### Key Insight:
At this point:
- Output power of the desired signal = P_signal
- Output power of the IM3 products = P_signal (same level)
- So, the **IM3 level is 0 dBc (decibels relative to carrier)**

This is an important point because:
- It’s not a normal operating condition—amplifiers are usually run well below this point to avoid excessive distortion.
- It defines the **maximum linear output power** before significant distortion occurs.
- In practice, the ""desired"" power level is often set lower than this (e.g., 10–20 dB below IP3) to maintain acceptable linearity.

### Summary:
If **IM3 equals desired**, then:
- Output power of the desired signal = IP3 (in absolute terms), and  
- The IM3 products have the same power level → so the amplifier is at saturation-level linearity.

But note: this is typically not a recommended operating point—it indicates the onset of significant distortion. For practical use, amplifiers are operated at much lower power levels (e.g., 10–15 dB below IP3).",35.0,0.0,0.03247010000000001

(Since \( 10^{0.3} \approx 2 \), more precisely:  
\( 10^{0.3} = e^{0.3 \ln 10} \approx e^{0.3 \times 2.3026} \approx e^{0.6908} \approx 1.995 \approx 2 \))

So we can take \( \gamma_b \approx 2 \).

- The modulated signal contains two sidebands: Upper Sideband (USB) and Lower Sideband (LSB).
- Each sideband has the same bandwidth as the original baseband signal.

- \( \lambda = 0.15 \, \text{m} \)

First compute the term inside the square:

\[
\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} = \frac{4 \pi \cdot 50}{0.15} = \frac{200\pi}{0.15} = \frac{200 \cdot 3.1416}{0.15} \approx \frac{628.32}{0.15} \approx 4188.8
