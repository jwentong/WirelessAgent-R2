"A binary source emits symbols with probabilities P(0)=0.6, P(1)=0.4. Calculate the entropy per symbol (in bits).","To calculate the entropy per symbol for a binary source, we use the formula for entropy:

\[
H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i
\]

For a binary source with symbols 0 and 1:

- \( P(0) = 0.6 \)
- \( P(1) = 0.4 \)

So the entropy is:

\[
H = -[P(0) \log_2 P(0) + P(1) \log_2 P(1)]
\]

\[
H = -[0.6 \log_2 0.6 + 0.4 \log_2 0.4]
\]

Now compute each term:

First, calculate the logarithms (base 2):

- \( \log_2 0.6 \approx \frac{\ln 0.6}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.5108}{0.6931} \approx -0.737 \)
- \( \log_2 0.4 \approx \frac{\ln 0.4}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.9163}{0.6931} \approx -1.322 \)

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of bits per sample,
- The constant 1.76 dB accounts for the signal power relative to the quantization noise (assuming a full-scale sine wave input).

Given:

A channel has bandwidth 1 MHz and SNR 10 dB. What is the Shannon capacity (in Mbps)?,"To calculate the **Shannon capacity** of a channel, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 1 \, \text{MHz} = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 10 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{10}{10}} = 10^1 = 10
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 10) = 10^6 \times \log_2(11)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(11) \):

\[
\log_2(11) = \frac{\log_{10}(11)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{1.0414}{0.3010} \approx 3.46
\]

So:

\[
C \approx 10^6 \times 3.46 = 3.46 \times 10^6 \, \text{bps} = 3.46 \, \text{Mbps}

"In a BPSK system, if the bit rate is 10 Mbps, what is the null-to-null bandwidth (in MHz)?","In a Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) system, the null-to-null bandwidth is determined by the bit rate and the modulation scheme.

For BPSK:
- The baseband signal has a bandwidth equal to the bit rate.
- When modulated to passband (RF), the null-to-null bandwidth of the RF spectrum is **twice** the bit rate.

This is because BPSK uses a carrier wave, and the resulting signal has symmetric sidebands around the carrier frequency. The first nulls occur at ± bit rate from the carrier, so the total null-to-null bandwidth is:

\[
\text{Null-to-null bandwidth} = 2 \times \text{bit rate}
\]

Given:

"For a zero-mean Gaussian noise with variance σ^2 = 0.01, what is the probability that the noise voltage exceeds 0.2 V?","We are given:

- Zero-mean Gaussian noise: \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \)
- Variance: \( \sigma^2 = 0.01 \), so standard deviation \( \sigma = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1 \)
- We want: \( P(X > 0.2) \)

---

### Step 1: Standardize the variable
Define the standard normal variable:
\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{X - 0}{0.1} = \frac{X}{0.1}
\]

So,
\[
P(X > 0.2) = P\left(Z > \frac{0.2}{0.1}\right) = P(Z > 2)

### Step 2: Use standard normal table or function
From standard normal distribution tables or using a calculator:

\[
P(Z > 2) = 1 - \Phi(2)

I(X;Y) = 1 − H(ε)

where H(ε) is the binary entropy function:

H(ε) = −ε log₂(ε) − (1−ε) log₂(1−ε)

Substitute ε = 0.1:

An FM signal has β=2 and f_m=2 kHz. How many significant sidebands are present according to Carson's rule?,"To determine the number of significant sidebands in an FM signal using Carson's rule, we follow these steps:

### Given:
- Modulation index: β = 2  
- Message frequency: fₘ = 2 kHz

### Carson’s Rule:
Carson’s rule states that the approximate bandwidth of an FM signal is:

\[
B \approx 2(\beta + 1)f_m
\]

This rule also suggests that the **significant sidebands** are those within ±(β + 1) sidebands from the carrier.

### Step-by-step:
- The number of significant sidebands on each side of the carrier is approximately **β + 1**.
- Since β = 2:

\[
\text{Number of significant sidebands per side} = \beta + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
\]

So, there are **3 sidebands on each side** (positive and negative) of the carrier.

### Total significant sidebands:
- Left side: 3
- Right side: 3
- Carrier: 1 (always present)

But typically, when asked for ""number of significant sidebands,"" it refers to the **total number of sideband pairs** (excluding the carrier), or sometimes just the number of sidebands on one side.

However, in standard usage:
- **""Significant sidebands""** — often means how many sidebands (on either side) have substantial amplitude, which corresponds to **β + 1** sidebands per side.

So if the question asks:  
> How many significant sidebands are present?

It usually implies the total number of sidebands (not including the carrier), i.e., 2 × (β + 1).

Thus:

"If a signal has bandwidth 20 kHz and is sampled at 50 kHz, what is the maximum frequency that can be reconstructed (in kHz)?","To determine the maximum frequency that can be reconstructed from a sampled signal, we must apply the **Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem**.

### Key Concepts:
- The **Nyquist rate** is twice the highest frequency component of the signal.
- To avoid aliasing and to reconstruct the original signal accurately, the sampling frequency must be **greater than or equal to twice the highest frequency** in the signal.

### Given:
- Signal bandwidth = 20 kHz → This means the highest frequency component is **20 kHz**.
- Sampling frequency = 50 kHz.

### Check Nyquist criterion:
- Nyquist rate = 2 × 20 kHz = 40 kHz.
- Since the sampling frequency (50 kHz) > 40 kHz, the signal is **properly sampled**.

### Maximum Frequency That Can Be Reconstructed:
The maximum frequency that can be reliably reconstructed without aliasing is the **Nyquist frequency**, which is:

\[
f_{\text{max}} = \frac{f_s}{2} = \frac{50\ \text{kHz}}{2} = 25\ \text{kHz}
\]

✅ However, note: the actual signal only contains frequencies up to 20 kHz. So while the system can reconstruct frequencies up to 25 kHz (due to the sampling rate), the signal itself has no content beyond 20 kHz.

### Step 1: Understand the relationship
For BPSK, the bit error rate (BER) is given by:
\[
\text{BER} = Q\left(\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]
The energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) is typically expressed in dB.

The **linear SNR** γ (often denoted as signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver input) for a single-bit transmission in BPSK is related to \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) as:
\[
\gamma = \frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]
(because in BPSK, each symbol carries 1 bit, so the average energy per symbol equals \( E_b \), and thus the SNR in linear terms is directly \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)).

So, if \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 9.6 \, \text{dB} \), then:

A signal has amplitude 2 V and is contaminated by AWGN with variance 0.01 V^2. What is the SNR (linear)?,"The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in linear terms is defined as:

\[

\]

Given:
- Signal amplitude = 2 V (assuming this is the peak amplitude of a deterministic signal)
- Noise is Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with variance = 0.01 V²

**Step 1: Calculate Signal Power**

For a **deterministic signal** with amplitude \( A \), the average power (for a sinusoidal signal or constant DC) is:

\[
P_{\text{signal}} = \frac{A^2}{2} \quad \text{(if it's a sine wave)}
\]

But if the signal is a **constant (DC) signal**, then its power is simply:

"For a zero-mean Gaussian process with PSD N0/2 = 10^{-9} W/Hz, what is the RMS voltage (in V) over 1 kΩ resistor?","We are given:

- Power Spectral Density (PSD) of a zero-mean Gaussian process:  
  \[
  \frac{N_0}{2} = 10^{-9} \, \text{W/Hz}
  \]
- Resistor value: \( R = 1 \, \text{k}\Omega = 1000 \, \Omega \)

We are to find the **RMS voltage** across this resistor.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between PSD and RMS voltage

For a wide-sense stationary random process, the total power \( P \) in a resistor is related to the PSD by integrating over all frequencies:

\[
P = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S_X(f) \, df
\]

Since the process is zero-mean Gaussian and we're told its PSD is flat (white noise), it means:

\[
S_X(f) = \frac{N_0}{2} = 10^{-9} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

This is the one-sided PSD. For white noise, the two-sided PSD would be \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W/Hz} \), but here it's already given as one-sided.

So total power dissipated in the resistor is:
\[
P = \frac{N_0}{2} \times \Delta f
\]

But wait — for white noise, if no bandwidth is specified, we typically assume it's infinite, which would imply infinite power — that’s not physical. So this must refer to the noise in a system with a finite bandwidth.

However, the question does **not specify bandwidth**, which implies we are being asked for the **RMS voltage due to the noise power spectral density**, i.e., the RMS voltage per unit bandwidth.

But actually, in many contexts, especially when asked for RMS voltage from PSD, they mean the RMS voltage **due to the entire noise bandwidth**, assuming the noise is white and the bandwidth is such that we can use the formula directly.

Wait — let’s re-read the problem:  
> What is the RMS voltage (in V) over 1 kΩ resistor?

This suggests that the noise is present over the entire frequency spectrum relevant to the resistor — but since it’s white noise, we must assume that the noise is integrated over all frequencies, which is unbounded — so that can’t be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking:  
**What is the RMS voltage across the resistor due to the noise with PSD \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 10^{-9} \) W/Hz**, assuming a bandwidth of 1 Hz?  

That makes sense — in many engineering contexts, when you’re given a PSD and asked for RMS voltage, and no bandwidth is specified, it’s often implied that the bandwidth is 1 Hz, or that you’re computing the RMS voltage per unit bandwidth.

But let’s consider another angle:

If the noise is white and has PSD \( \frac{N_0}{2} \), then the power in a resistor \( R \) due to noise over bandwidth \( B \) is:

\[
P = \frac{N_0}{2} \cdot B \quad \text{(for one-sided PSD)}
\]

Then, since \( P = \frac{V_{\text{rms}}^2}{R} \), we solve for \( V_{\text{rms}} \):

\[
V_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{P \cdot R} = \sqrt{\frac{N_0}{2} \cdot B \cdot R}
\]

But again, no \( B \) is given!

Wait — hold on! The problem says:

> For a zero-mean Gaussian process with PSD \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 10^{-9} \) W/Hz

Note: This is a standard way to write the one-sided PSD of white noise. In many textbooks, \( \frac{N_0}{2} \) is used for the one-sided PSD.

Now, in practice, when such a question is asked without specifying bandwidth, it often implies that the noise is over an effective bandwidth of 1 Hz — or more commonly, it's asking for the RMS voltage **in a 1 Hz bandwidth**.

Let’s take that approach — assume bandwidth \( B = 1 \, \text{Hz} \).

Then:
- Power in 1 Hz:  
  \[
  P = \frac{N_0}{2} \cdot 1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{W}
  \]
- Then RMS voltage:
  \[
  V_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{P \cdot R} = \sqrt{10^{-9} \cdot 1000} = \sqrt{10^{-6}} = 10^{-3} \, \text{V} = 1 \, \text{mV}
  \]

✅ That seems clean.

But is there another interpretation?

Some might think: since \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 10^{-9} \), then \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-9} \), and then use the two-sided PSD. But the problem gives \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 10^{-9} \), so the one-sided PSD is known. That is standard notation.

So our calculation is correct under the assumption of 1 Hz bandwidth — a common convention when no bandwidth is given.

where \( H(p) \) is the binary entropy function:

\[

\]

### Step-by-step calculation:

Given:
- \( p = 0.1 \)

Compute \( H(0.1) \):

\[
H(0.1) = -0.1 \log_2(0.1) - 0.9 \log_2(0.9)

We compute each term:

- \( \log_2(0.1) = \frac{\ln(0.1)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-2.3026}{0.6931} \approx -3.3219 \)
- So, \( -0.1 \times (-3.3219) = 0.33219 \)

- \( \log_2(0.9) = \frac{\ln(0.9)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.1054}{0.6931} \approx -0.1520 \)

### Explanation:
- **E** is the energy of the input signal.
- **N₀/2** is the power spectral density (PSD) of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
- The matched filter maximizes the SNR at the sampling instant, and the maximum output SNR is directly proportional to the signal energy and inversely proportional to the noise power.

This result comes from the matched filter's impulse response being a time-reversed and scaled version of the transmitted signal, which optimally correlates with the signal in the presence of noise.

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Bit Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}

However, the problem gives the **symbol rate** (1 MBaud), not the bit rate directly. To proceed, we need to know how many bits are carried per symbol — this depends on the modulation scheme.

But since no modulation is specified, we often assume the simplest case: **binary modulation (e.g., BPSK)**, where each symbol carries 1 bit.

### Step-by-step:
- Symbol rate = 1 MBaud = \(1 \times 10^6\) symbols/second  
- If each symbol carries 1 bit → Bit rate = \(1 \times 10^6\) bps

- Bandwidth = 10 kHz → This means the highest frequency in the signal is 10 kHz (assuming baseband signal with no DC offset or other complexities).
  
So, the Nyquist rate is:

\[

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=0?","For a rectangular pulse of duration T, the energy spectral density (ESD) at f = 0 is:

**T**

### Explanation:

The rectangular pulse function can be defined as:

\[
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & |t| \leq T/2 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

The energy spectral density is the magnitude squared of the Fourier Transform of x(t):

\[
S_{xx}(f) = |X(f)|^2
\]

The Fourier Transform of the rectangular pulse is:

\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]

where \(\text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T}\) (using the normalized sinc function).

At \(f = 0\), the sinc function evaluates to 1:

\[
X(0) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(0) = T \cdot 1 = T
\]

Therefore, the energy spectral density at f = 0 is:

\[
S_{xx}(0) = |X(0)|^2 = T^2

### Step 1: Understand 16-QAM
- In 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), each symbol represents **log₂(16) = 4 bits**.
- So, 1 symbol carries 4 bits.

### Step 2: Use the relationship between bit rate and symbol rate
\[
\text{Bit Rate} = \text{Symbol Rate} \times \log_2(M)
\]
Where:
- \( M = 16 \) → \( \log_2(16) = 4 \)

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is a sinc function:

"In a (7,4) Hamming code, what is the minimum Hamming distance?","In a (7,4) Hamming code, the **minimum Hamming distance is 3**.

### Explanation:
- A (7,4) Hamming code encodes 4 data bits into 7-bit codewords by adding 3 parity bits.
- The minimum Hamming distance (d_min) of a linear code is the smallest number of positions in which any two distinct codewords differ.
- For Hamming codes in general, the minimum distance is always **3**.
- This means:
  - The code can **detect up to 2 errors**.
  - The code can **correct 1 error**.

This property arises from the way parity bits are designed to cover different combinations of bit positions, ensuring that no two valid codewords differ in fewer than 3 positions.",3.0,1.0,0.028920100000000008

A channel has bandwidth 200 kHz and SNR 10 dB. What is the Shannon capacity (in kbps)?,"To calculate the **Shannon capacity** of a channel, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (as a linear ratio, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 200 \, \text{kHz} = 200,000 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 10 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to a linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{10}{10}} = 10^1 = 10

- Word length = 5 bits
- We want the probability that **exactly one bit** is in error.

This is a classic **binomial probability** problem.

The binomial probability formula is:

\[

\]

Where:
- \( n = 5 \) (number of bits),

However, in this problem, we are given the **symbol rate** (500 kBaud) and the **bandwidth** (400 kHz). To proceed, we need to determine the **bit rate**.

If we assume **one bit per symbol** (which is the case for binary modulation like BPSK), then:

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 20-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 20-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the pulse drops by 20 dB from its peak value.

### Step 1: Fourier Transform of Rectangular Pulse
The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) (and amplitude 1) is:

\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]
where \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \).

The peak of the spectrum occurs at \( f = 0 \), and \( |X(0)| = T \).

### Step 2: Define 20-dB Bandwidth
A 20-dB drop means the power is reduced to \( 10^{-20/10} = 10^{-2} = 0.01 \) of the peak power.

Since power is proportional to the square of the magnitude, this corresponds to:
\[
|X(f)|^2 = (0.01) \cdot |X(0)|^2
\Rightarrow |X(f)| = 0.1 \cdot |X(0)|
\]

So we solve for \( f \) such that:
\[
|T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)| = 0.1 \cdot T
\Rightarrow |\text{sinc}(fT)| = 0.1
\]

Let \( x = fT \). Then:
\[
|\text{sinc}(x)| = 0.1
\Rightarrow \left| \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right| = 0.1
\]

This equation must be solved numerically for \( x \). The first positive solution (since sinc is symmetric) occurs where:
\[
\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} = 0.1 \quad (\text{for } x > 0)
\]

Using numerical methods or standard tables:
- The first zero-crossing of sinc occurs at \( x = 1 \).
- The first lobe maximum occurs near \( x \approx 1.43 \), but we need where the function drops to 0.1.

By solving numerically:
\[
x \approx 1.275
\]

Thus, the frequency where \( |X(f)| = 0.1 |X(0)| \) is:
\[
f = \frac{x}{T} \approx \frac{1.275}{T}
\]

So the **20-dB bandwidth** is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1.275}{T}}
\]

> ✅ This is the full-width 20-dB bandwidth — meaning from \( -\frac{1.275}{T} \) to \( +\frac{1.275}{T} \), so the total bandwidth is \( \frac{2.55}{T} \), but typically ""bandwidth"" refers to the one-sided (positive) value unless specified otherwise. In many contexts, especially in signal processing, the 20-dB bandwidth refers to the one-sided frequency where the magnitude drops to 10% of the peak — hence \( \frac{1.275}{T} \).

  - \( P(X = 1) = 0.5 \)

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 0, i.e., \( P(Y = 0) \).

---

### Step-by-step solution:

The output \( Y \) depends on the input \( X \) and the channel behavior.

Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Y = 0) = P(Y = 0 \mid X = 0)P(X = 0) + P(Y = 0 \mid X = 1)P(X = 1)
\]

From the BSC properties:

- \( P(Y = 0 \mid X = 0) = 1 - p = 0.7 \) (no error)
- \( P(Y = 0 \mid X = 1) = p = 0.3 \) (error occurred)

Substitute values:

\[
P(Y = 0) = (0.7)(0.5) + (0.3)(0.5) = 0.35 + 0.15 = 0.5

"In a digital communication system, the symbol rate is 1 MBaud and the bandwidth is 800 kHz. What is the spectral efficiency (in bps/Hz)?","To calculate the **spectral efficiency** in **bps/Hz**, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Bit Rate (bps)}}{\text{Bandwidth (Hz)}}
\]

However, we are given the **symbol rate** (1 MBaud = 1 × 10⁶ symbols per second), not the bit rate directly.

To proceed, we need to know how many bits are carried per symbol. This depends on the modulation scheme. But since it's not specified, we assume the simplest case: **each symbol carries 1 bit** (like in BPSK). If more bits per symbol are used (e.g., QPSK = 2 bits/symbol), the spectral efficiency increases accordingly.

But here’s the key point:  
If you're only given symbol rate and bandwidth, and no modulation type, the **maximum possible spectral efficiency** is limited by the Nyquist formula:

\[
\text{Maximum Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Symbol Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}
\]

This gives the **maximum achievable spectrality under ideal conditions** (assuming no guard bands or roll-off).

Given:
- Symbol Rate = 1 MBaud = 1 × 10⁶ symbols/s
- Bandwidth = 800 kHz = 800 × 10³ Hz

So:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{1 \times 10^6}{800 \times 10^3} = \frac{1000000}{800000} = 1.25 \, \text{symbols/Hz}
\]

But if we assume each symbol carries **1 bit** (as in binary modulation), then:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = 1.25 \, \text{bps/Hz}
\]

✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1.25} \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

Note: If a higher-order modulation were used (e.g., 4-QAM, 16-QAM), the bit rate would be higher, and so would the spectral efficiency. But without any indication of the modulation, the standard assumption for this kind of problem is that 1 bit per symbol is being transmitted — hence, 1.25 bps/Hz.",1.25,0.0,0.04030075000000003
"For a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 9, what is the probability that the value is greater than 3?","We are given a Gaussian (normal) distribution with:

- Mean μ = 0  
- Variance σ² = 9 → Standard deviation σ = √9 = 3

We are asked to find the probability that a value X is greater than 3:

$$

### Step 1: Standardize the variable
Convert X to a standard normal variable Z using the formula:

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{3 - 0}{3} = 1

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=0.5/T?","For a rectangular pulse of duration \( T \), the energy spectral density (ESD) is given by the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform.

### Step 1: Define the Rectangular Pulse
Let the rectangular pulse be:
\[
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
1, & |t| \leq \frac{T}{2} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

This is a normalized pulse with amplitude 1 and duration \( T \).

### Step 2: Fourier Transform of the Rectangular Pulse
The Fourier transform of \( x(t) \) is:
\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]
where \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \), and we use the normalized sinc function \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \).

### Step 3: Energy Spectral Density
The energy spectral density is:
\[
S_{xx}(f) = |X(f)|^2 = T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(fT)
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate at \( f = \frac{0.5}{T} \)
Substitute \( f = \frac{0.5}{T} \):
\[
S_{xx}\left(\frac{0.5}{T}\right) = T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2\left(\frac{0.5}{T} \cdot T\right) = T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(0.5)

First, compute the logarithms:

- \( \log_2 0.12 = \frac{\ln 0.12}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-2.1203}{0.6931} \approx -3.059 \)
- \( \log_2 0.88 = \frac{\ln 0.88}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.1278}{0.6931} \approx -0.1843 \)

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 30-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 30-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of its Fourier transform (which is a sinc function) drops by 30 dB from its peak value.

### Step-by-step:

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) (from \( -T/2 \) to \( T/2 \)) is:

\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]
where \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \), and in some definitions, it's \( \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \). For consistency with engineering usage, we use:
\[
\text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T}
\]

The peak of the magnitude occurs at \( f = 0 \), where \( |X(0)| = T \).

We want the frequency \( f_{30} \) such that:
\[
|X(f_{30})| = T \times 10^{-30/20} = T \times 10^{-1.5} \approx T \times 0.03162
\]

So:
\[
| \text{sinc}(f_{30} T) | = 0.03162
\]

Let \( x = f_{30} T \), then we solve:
\[
\left| \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right| = 0.03162
\]

This equation must be solved numerically. The first positive root of this equation (since the first zero-crossing of the sinc is at \( x = 1 \)) is approximately:

\[
x \approx 4.603
\]

(Since the sinc function has its first sidelobe at about \( x = 1.43 \), and the 30 dB point corresponds to a much larger \( x \), we look for the first point where the magnitude is ≈ 0.03162.)

Thus:
\[
f_{30} T \approx 4.603 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f_{30} \approx \frac{4.603}{T}
\]

### Final Answer:
The **30-dB bandwidth** of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is approximately:

\[
\boxed{\frac{4.6}{T}} \quad \text{(in units of Hz)}

This is commonly approximated as \( \frac{4.6}{T} \) or sometimes rounded to \( \frac{4.5}{T} \) depending on the source, but 4.6 is more accurate.",0.15,0.0,0.005179400000000001

- The input symbols are **equally likely**, so:
  - \( P(X = 0) = 0.5 \)
  - \( P(X = 1) = 0.5 \)

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 1, i.e., \( P(Y = 1) \).

### Step-by-step:

In a BSC:
- If input is 0, output is 1 with probability \( p = 0.4 \), and 0 with probability \( 1 - p = 0.6 \).
- If input is 1, output is 0 with probability \( p = 0.4 \), and 1 with probability \( 1 - p = 0.6 \).

\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Data Rate (bps)}}{\text{Bandwidth (Hz)}}
\]

We are given:
- Symbol rate = 2 MBaud = 2 × 10⁶ symbols per second
- Bandwidth = 1.5 MHz = 1.5 × 10⁶ Hz

However, to compute the data rate in bits per second (bps), we need to know how many bits per symbol are being transmitted — that is, the modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK = 2 bits/symbol, 16-QAM = 4 bits/symbol, etc.).

But the problem does **not** specify the number of bits per symbol.

In such cases, if no modulation is specified, a common assumption is that each symbol represents **1 bit**, i.e., binary modulation like BPSK.

So, under this assumption:
- Data rate = Symbol rate × bits per symbol = 2 × 10⁶ bps

"For a sinusoidal modulating signal, what is the modulation index if the carrier amplitude is 15 V and the sideband amplitude is 4.5 V?","To find the **modulation index** (denoted as \( m \)) for a sinusoidal modulating signal, we use the relationship between the **sideband amplitude** and the **carrier amplitude** in amplitude modulation (AM).

For a standard AM wave:
- The carrier amplitude is \( A_c \)
- The sideband amplitude (for each sideband) is \( \frac{m A_c}{2} \)

Given:

\]

Given:
- Crossover probability \( p = 0.18 \)

### Step 1: Compute \( H(0.18) \)

\[
H(0.18) = -0.18 \log_2 0.18 - (1 - 0.18) \log_2 (0.82)
\]

First, compute the logs:

- \( \log_2 0.18 = \frac{\log_{10} 0.18}{\log_{10} 2} \approx \frac{-0.7447}{0.3010} \approx -2.474 \)

where \( f_{\text{max}} \) is the highest frequency component in the signal.

Given:
- The signal has a **bandwidth of 25 kHz**.  
  This typically means the signal extends from 0 to 25 kHz (baseband signal), so \( f_{\text{max}} = 25 \) kHz.

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=0.25/T?","To find the energy spectral density (ESD) of a rectangular pulse at a specific frequency, we need to follow these steps:

### 1. **Rectangular Pulse Definition**
A rectangular pulse of duration \( T \) and amplitude \( A \) can be written as:
\[
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & |t| \leq \frac{T}{2} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Assume \( A = 1 \) for simplicity unless specified otherwise — this is common when computing ESDs (since ESD is proportional to \( A^2 \)).

### 2. **Fourier Transform of Rectangular Pulse**
The Fourier transform of \( x(t) \) is:
\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]
where \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \)

### 3. **Energy Spectral Density (ESD)**
The ESD is given by the magnitude squared of the Fourier transform:
\[
S_{xx}(f) = |X(f)|^2 = T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(fT)
\]

### 4. **Evaluate at \( f = 0.25 / T \)**
Plug in \( f = \frac{0.25}{T} \):

First compute \( fT = \frac{0.25}{T} \cdot T = 0.25 \)

Then:
\[
S_{xx}\left( \frac{0.25}{T} \right) = T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(0.25)
\]

Now compute \( \text{sinc}(0.25) \):
\[
\text{sinc}(0.25) = \frac{\sin(\pi \cdot 0.25)}{\pi \cdot 0.25} = \frac{\sin(\pi/4)}{\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2}{\pi/4} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi}
\]

So:
\[
\text{sinc}^2(0.25) = \left( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\pi} \right)^2 = \frac{8}{\pi^2}
\]

Therefore:
\[
S_{xx}\left( \frac{0.25}{T} \right) = T^2 \cdot \frac{8}{\pi^2} = \frac{8T^2}{\pi^2}

- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 400 \, \text{kHz} = 400,000 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 7 dB

First, convert SNR from dB to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{7}{10}} = 10^{0.7} \approx 5.0119

Now plug into Shannon’s formula:

\[
C = 400,000 \times \log_2(1 + 5.0119) = 400,000 \times \log_2(6.0119)

Given the probabilities:
- \( p_1 = 0.6 \)
- \( p_2 = 0.2 \)
- \( p_3 = 0.1 \)
- \( p_4 = 0.1 \)

Now compute each term:

\[
-0.6 \log_2(0.6) = -0.6 \times \log_2\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) = -0.6 \times (\log_2 3 - \log_2 5)

So:
\[
\log_2(0.6) \approx 1.58496 - 2.32193 = -0.73697

   |\text{sinc}(fT)| = 0.01
   \]

4. **Solve for \( f \)**:
   Let \( x = fT \). We need:
   \[
   \left| \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right| = 0.01
   \]
   This equation must be solved numerically or using known approximations.

   From standard tables or numerical methods:
   - The first zero-crossing of sinc occurs at \( x = 1 \).
   - The value of \( \text{sinc}(x) \) drops to 0.01 around \( x \approx 5.13 \) (this is a well-known approximation).

   Thus,
   \[
   fT \approx 5.13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f \approx \frac{5.13}{T}
   \]

5. **Bandwidth**:
   Since the spectrum is symmetric, the 40-dB bandwidth (full width) is:
   \[
   B_{40\text{dB}} \approx 2 \times \frac{5.13}{T} = \frac{10.26}{T}

"If the bit rate is 15 Mbps and the modulation is BPSK, what is the null-to-null bandwidth (in MHz)?","For Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), the null-to-null bandwidth is equal to the bit rate.

This is because BPSK transmits one bit per symbol, so the symbol rate (baud rate) equals the bit rate. The null-to-null bandwidth of a BPSK signal is approximately:

\[
B = R_b
\]

where:
- \( R_b \) is the bit rate in bits per second,

"A binary symmetric channel has crossover probability 0.35. If the input symbols are equally likely, what is the probability of receiving a 1?","We are given:

- A **binary symmetric channel (BSC)** with crossover probability \( p = 0.35 \).
- Input symbols are equally likely:  
  \( P(X = 0) = P(X = 1) = 0.5 \).

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a **1**, i.e., \( P(Y = 1) \).

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

In a BSC:
- With probability \( 1 - p \), the transmitted bit is received correctly.
- With probability \( p \), it is flipped.

So, the probability of receiving a 1 can happen in two ways:
1. A 0 was sent and flipped to 1:  
   \( P(X = 0) \cdot p = 0.5 \cdot 0.35 = 0.175 \)
2. A 1 was sent and received as 1 (no flip):  
   \( P(X = 1) \cdot (1 - p) = 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.35) = 0.5 \cdot 0.65 = 0.325 \)

Now, add both cases:
\[
P(Y = 1) = 0.175 + 0.325 = 0.5
\]

---

"In a (31,26) Hamming code, what is the minimum Hamming distance?","In a (31,26) Hamming code, the minimum Hamming distance is **3**.

### Explanation:
- A Hamming code is a linear error-correcting code designed to detect and correct single-bit errors.
- The standard Hamming code has parameters (n, k), where:
  - n = total number of bits in a codeword
  - k = number of data bits
  - r = number of parity bits, such that n = k + r

For a (31,26) Hamming code:
- n = 31
- k = 26
- So r = 5 parity bits

This corresponds to a Hamming code where the number of parity bits satisfies:
\[
2^r \geq n + 1
\]
Check:
\[
2^5 = 32 \geq 31 + 1 = 32 \quad \text{✓}
\]

The key property of any Hamming code is that its **minimum Hamming distance d = 3**. This means:
- It can detect up to 2-bit errors
- It can correct 1-bit errors

A channel has bandwidth 3 MHz and SNR 12 dB. What is the Shannon capacity (in Mbps)?,"To calculate the **Shannon capacity** of a channel, we use the formula:

\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale

Given:
- SNR = 12 dB

Convert to linear:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{12}{10}} = 10^{1.2} \approx 15.8489
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into Shannon formula

\[
C = 3 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 15.8489) = 3 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(16.8489)

The binomial probability formula is:

\]

Where:
- \( n = 12 \)
- \( k = 1 \)
- \( p = 0.002 \)

So,

\[

First, compute \( \ln(0.998) \approx -0.002002 \) (using calculator or approximation)

Then:

\[

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=0.75/T?","To find the energy spectral density (ESD) of a rectangular pulse at a specific frequency, let's go through the steps.

### 1. **Rectangular Pulse Definition**
A rectangular pulse of duration \( T \), amplitude \( A \), and centered at \( t = 0 \) is given by:

\[
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & |t| \leq \frac{T}{2} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

### 2. **Fourier Transform of Rectangular Pulse**
The Fourier transform of this pulse is:

\[
X(f) = A T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]

where \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \)

> Note: Some definitions use \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x} \), so be careful with conventions. Here we use \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \), which is common in signal processing.

### 3. **Energy Spectral Density (ESD)**
The ESD is:

\[
S_{xx}(f) = |X(f)|^2
\]

So,

\[
S_{xx}(f) = \left| A T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT) \right|^2 = A^2 T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(fT)
\]

### 4. **Evaluate at \( f = \frac{3}{4T} \)**

Let’s plug in \( f = \frac{3}{4T} \):

\[
fT = \frac{3}{4T} \cdot T = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Then:

\[
\text{sinc}\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) = \frac{\sin\left( \pi \cdot \frac{3}{4} \right)}{\pi \cdot \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sin\left( \frac{3\pi}{4} \right)}{\frac{3\pi}{4}}
\]

We know that:
\[
\sin\left( \frac{3\pi}{4} \right) = \sin(135^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

So:

\[
\text{sinc}\left( \frac{3}{4} \right) = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}}{\frac{3\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{3\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3\pi}
\]

Now square it for the ESD:

\[
S_{xx}\left( \frac{3}{4T} \right) = A^2 T^2 \cdot \left( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3\pi} \right)^2 = A^2 T^2 \cdot \frac{8}{9\pi^2}
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
S_{xx}\left( \frac{3}{4T} \right) = \frac{8 A^2 T^2}{9\pi^2}
\]

"In a digital system, if the bit rate is 100 Mbps and the modulation is 64-QAM, what is the symbol rate (in MBaud)?","To calculate the symbol rate (in MBaud) given the bit rate and modulation scheme:

### Given:
- Bit rate = 100 Mbps  
- Modulation = 64-QAM

### Key Concept:
In **64-QAM**, each symbol represents **log₂(64) = 6 bits**.

So, the relationship between bit rate (R) and symbol rate (S) is:

\[
R = S \times \log_2(M)

- \( R \) = bit rate (in bits per second)
- \( S \) = symbol rate (in symbols per second, or Baud)
- \( M \) = number of points in the constellation (64 for 64-QAM)

### Rearranging for symbol rate:
\[
S = \frac{R}{\log_2(M)} = \frac{100 \text{ Mbps}}{6} = \frac{100}{6} \text{ MBaud}

A channel has bandwidth 600 kHz and SNR 9 dB. What is the Shannon capacity (in kbps)?,"To calculate the **Shannon capacity** of a channel, we use the formula:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (as a linear ratio, not in dB)

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale

Given SNR = 9 dB,

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{9}{10}} = 10^{0.9} \approx 7.943

---

### Step 2: Plug into Shannon's formula

Bandwidth \( B = 600 \) kHz = \( 600,000 \) Hz

\[
C = 600,\!000 \times \log_2(1 + 7.943) = 600,\!000 \times \log_2(8.943)

Now compute \( \log_2(8.943) \):

\[
\log_2(8.943) = \frac{\log_{10}(8.943)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.951}{0.3010} \approx 3.16

"In a digital system, the symbol error rate is 5×10^-6. If the modulation is 16-QAM with Gray coding, what is approximate bit error rate?","To estimate the bit error rate (BER) from the symbol error rate (SER) in a 16-QAM system with Gray coding, we use the following relationship:

For M-ary QAM with Gray coding, the approximate BER is:

\[
\text{BER} \approx \frac{4}{\log_2(M)} \cdot \frac{1}{M - 1} \cdot \text{SER}
\]

But for practical and commonly used approximations—especially when SER is small (like 5×10⁻⁶)—we can use the simpler and well-known approximation for 16-QAM:

\[
\text{BER} \approx \frac{3}{4} \cdot \text{SER}
\]

**Why?**  
In 16-QAM (M = 16), each symbol represents 4 bits. With Gray coding, a single symbol error typically results in only 1 or 2 incorrect bits out of 4. The average number of bit errors per symbol error is approximately 1.5 bits per symbol. So:

\[
\text{BER} \approx \frac{1.5}{4} \cdot \text{SER} = \frac{3}{8} \cdot \text{SER}
\]

Wait—that’s not quite right either. Let me recall the exact standard approximation.

Actually, for 16-QAM with Gray coding, a good approximation is:

\[
\text{BER} \approx \frac{3}{4} \cdot \text{SER}
\]

This comes from the fact that in 16-QAM, the average number of bit errors per symbol error is about 1.5, and since each symbol carries 4 bits:

\[
\text{BER} \approx \frac{1.5}{4} \cdot \text{SER} = 0.375 \cdot \text{SER}
\]

So, more precisely:
\[
\text{BER} \approx 0.375 \times \text{SER}
\]

Given:
\[
\text{SER} = 5 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Then:
\[
\text{BER} \approx 0.375 \times 5 \times 10^{-6} = 1.875 \times 10^{-6}

✅ **Final Answer:**
\[
\text{BER} \approx 1.875 \times 10^{-6}

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 50-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 50-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of the Fourier transform (spectrum) of the pulse drops by 50 dB from its peak value.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Fourier Transform of a Rectangular Pulse**:
   A rectangular pulse of width \( T \) and height 1 (normalized) has a Fourier transform:
   \[
   \text{rect}(t/T) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} T \cdot \text{sinc}(\pi f T)
   \]
   where \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \), and in this case, we define it as \( \text{sinc}(\pi f T) \).

2. **Peak of the Spectrum**:
   At \( f = 0 \), the sinc function is 1, so the peak magnitude is \( T \).

3. **50-dB Down Point**:
   A 50 dB drop means:
   \[
   20 \log_{10}\left( \frac{|X(f)|}{|X(0)|} \right) = -50
   \]
   So:
   \[
   \frac{|X(f)|}{|X(0)|} = 10^{-50/20} = 10^{-2.5} = 0.003162
   \]

   Since \( |X(f)| = T |\text{sinc}(\pi f T)| \), and \( |X(0)| = T \), this reduces to:
   \[
   |\text{sinc}(\pi f T)| = 0.003162
   \]

4. **Solve for \( f \)**:
   We need to find \( f \) such that:
   \[
   \left| \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \right| = 0.003162
   \]
   Let \( x = \pi f T \). Then:
   \[
   \left| \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \right| = 0.003162
   \]

   This equation must be solved numerically. The first positive solution (since the sinc function oscillates and decays) occurs at approximately:
   \[
   x \approx 8.985
   \]
   (This can be found using root-finding methods or known approximations.)

   So:
   \[
   \pi f T \approx 8.985 \Rightarrow f \approx \frac{8.985}{\pi T}
   \]

   Therefore, the 50-dB bandwidth is:
   \[
   B_{50} \approx \frac{8.985}{\pi T} \approx \frac{2.86}{T}
   \]

### ✅ Final Answer:
The 50-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is approximately:
\[
\boxed{\frac{2.86}{T}}
\]

"If the bit rate is 25 Mbps and the modulation is BPSK, what is the null-to-null bandwidth (in MHz)?","To calculate the null-to-null bandwidth for a BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) modulated signal, we use the following relationship:

- The symbol rate \( R_s \) equals the bit rate \( R_b \), since each symbol carries 1 bit.
- The null-to-null bandwidth of a BPSK signal is approximately equal to twice the symbol rate.

So, if the bit rate \( R_b = 25 \) Mbps, then:

\[
R_s = 25 \text{ Mbps}

\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = \frac{2E}{N_0}
\]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the input signal (in joules),
- \( N_0 \) is the noise power spectral density (in W/Hz).

Given:
- \( E = 4 \, \mu\text{J} = 4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{J} \)
- \( N_0 = 4 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

Plug into the formula:

\[

"A binary symmetric channel has crossover probability 0.45. If the input symbols are equally likely, what is the probability of receiving a 0?","We are given:

- A **binary symmetric channel (BSC)** with crossover probability \( p = 0.45 \).
- Input symbols are equally likely: \( P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 0.5 \).

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 0, i.e., \( P(Y=0) \).

---

### Step-by-step solution:

In a BSC:
- If input is 0, output is 0 with probability \( 1 - p \), and 1 with probability \( p \).
- If input is 1, output is 1 with probability \( 1 - p \), and 0 with probability \( p \).

So, using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Y=0) = P(Y=0 | X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=0 | X=1)P(X=1)
\]

Substitute known values:
- \( P(Y=0 | X=0) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55 \)
- \( P(Y=0 | X=1) = p = 0.45 \)
- \( P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 0.5 \)

Now compute:

\[
P(Y=0) = (0.55)(0.5) + (0.45)(0.5) = 0.275 + 0.225 = 0.5
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[

A channel has bandwidth 5 MHz and SNR 15 dB. What is the Shannon capacity (in Mbps)?,"To calculate the **Shannon capacity**, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[

\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (as a linear ratio, not in dB)

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale

Given:
- SNR = 15 dB

Convert to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{15}{10}} = 10^{1.5} = 31.623
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the formula

Bandwidth \( B = 5 \, \text{MHz} = 5 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)

\[
C = 5 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 31.623) = 5 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(32.623)

Now compute \( \log_2(32.623) \):

\[
\log_2(32.623) = \frac{\log_{10}(32.623)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{1.513}{0.3010} \approx 5.027

Given:
- Bit duration \( T_b = 0.025 \, \mu\text{s} = 0.025 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \)

First, calculate the bit rate \( R_b \):

\[
R_b = \frac{1}{T_b} = \frac{1}{0.025 \times 10^{-6}} = 40 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits per second} = 40 \, \text{Mbps}
\]

For BPSK, the null-to-null bandwidth of the transmitted signal (assuming no pulse shaping or filtering) is approximately:

\[
B_{\text{null-to-null}} = 2 \times R_b
\]

This is because BPSK uses a baseband signal with a sinc-shaped spectrum, and the first nulls occur at ±\( R_b \), so the total null-to-null bandwidth is \( 2R_b \).

\[
B_{\text{null-to-null}} = 2 \times 40 \, \text{MHz} = 80 \, \text{MHz}

"In a binary system, if the bit error probability is 0.0005, what is the probability that a 16-bit word has no error?","To find the probability that a 16-bit word has **no error**, given that the bit error probability is \( p = 0.0005 \), we assume:

- Each bit is independent.
- A ""no error"" means all 16 bits are transmitted correctly.

The probability that a single bit is **correct** is:
\[
1 - p = 1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995
\]

Since the bits are independent, the probability that all 16 bits are correct is:
\[
(0.9995)^{16}

Now compute this value:
\[
(0.9995)^{16} \approx e^{16 \cdot \ln(0.9995)}

First, approximate \( \ln(0.9995) \):
\[
\ln(0.9995) \approx -0.000500125

Then:
\[
16 \cdot \ln(0.9995) \approx 16 \cdot (-0.000500125) = -0.008002

Now:
\[
e^{-0.008002} \approx 1 - 0.008002 + \frac{(0.008002)^2}{2} \approx 0.99201

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Bit Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}
\]

However, the problem gives us the **symbol rate** (4 MBaud), not the bit rate directly. To proceed, we need to know how many bits are conveyed per symbol — i.e., the modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM, etc.). But since that's not provided, we must assume the simplest case: **1 bit per symbol**, which corresponds to binary modulation (like BPSK).

So, if:

- Mean μ = 0  
- Variance σ² = 2 → Standard deviation σ = √2

We want to find:

**P(X > 2)**

### Step 1: Standardize the variable
Convert X to a standard normal variable Z using:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{2 - 0}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142
\]

Now, we need:

\[
P(X > 2) = P(Z > \sqrt{2}) \approx P(Z > 1.4142)
\]

### Step 2: Use standard normal table or calculator
Look up the cumulative standard normal probability:

\[
P(Z > 1.4142) = 1 - P(Z \leq 1.4142)
\]

From standard normal tables or a calculator:
- \( P(Z \leq 1.41) \approx 0.9207 \)
- \( P(Z \leq 1.42) \approx 0.9222 \)

Interpolating for 1.4142:

Given the probabilities:

We compute each term:

1. For \( p = 0.4 \):
\[
-0.4 \log_2(0.4) = -0.4 \times \log_2(2^{-1.3219}) \approx -0.4 \times (-1.3219) = 0.52876
\]
(A more precise calculation: \( \log_2(0.4) \approx -1.3219 \))

So:
\[
-0.4 \log_2(0.4) \approx 0.52876
\]

Same for the second symbol (also 0.4): another 0.52876

2. For \( p = 0.1 \):
\[
-0.1 \log_2(0.1) = -0.1 \times \log_2(10^{-1}) \approx -0.1 \times (-3.3219) = 0.33219

\]

We compute each term:

- \( \log_2(0.25) = \log_2(1/4) = -2 \)
- \( \log_2(0.75) \approx \log_2(3/4) = \log_2(3) - \log_2(4) \approx 1.58496 - 2 = -0.41504 \)

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 60-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 60-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the pulse drops by 60 dB relative to its peak value.

### Step-by-step:

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is:

\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]

where \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \).

The magnitude is:

\[
|X(f)| = |T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)| = T \left| \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \right|
\]

The peak occurs at \( f = 0 \), where \( |X(0)| = T \).

We want the frequency \( f_{60} \) such that:

\[
20 \log_{10} \left( \frac{|X(f_{60})|}{|X(0)|} \right) = -60 \, \text{dB}
\]

So:

\[
\frac{|X(f_{60})|}{T} = 10^{-3} = 0.001
\]

This gives:

\[
\left| \text{sinc}(f_{60} T) \right| = 0.001
\]

Let \( x = f_{60} T \). Then we solve:

\[
|\text{sinc}(x)| = 0.001
\]

We are looking for the first positive solution to:

\[
\left| \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right| = 0.001
\]

This equation must be solved numerically or using known approximations.

It is well known from signal processing literature that the 60-dB bandwidth (i.e., the first null in the sinc envelope at -60 dB) of a rectangular pulse occurs when:

\[
f_{60} \approx \frac{2.76}{T}
\]

This value comes from solving \( |\text{sinc}(x)| = 0.001 \), which yields \( x \approx 2.76 \).

### ✅ Final Answer:

  - \( P(X = 1) = 0.5 \)

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 1, i.e., \( P(Y = 1) \).

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Y = 1) = P(Y = 1 | X = 0)P(X = 0) + P(Y = 1 | X = 1)P(X = 1)
\]

From the BSC definition:
- \( P(Y = 1 | X = 0) = p = 0.5 \) (crossover: 0 becomes 1)
- \( P(Y = 1 | X = 1) = 1 - p = 0.5 \) (no crossover: 1 stays 1)

Substitute:

\[
P(Y = 1) = (0.5)(0.5) + (0.5)(0.5) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[

\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 10 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 10^7 \times \log_2(101)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(101) \):

\[
\log_2(101) = \frac{\log_{10}(101)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{2.0043}{0.3010} \approx 6.659
\]

Now compute capacity:

\[

"For BPSK, if the bit duration is 0.01 μs, what is the null-to-null bandwidth (in MHz)?","For BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), the null-to-null bandwidth is determined by the bit rate and the modulation scheme.

Given:
- Bit duration \( T_b = 0.01 \, \mu\text{s} = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \)

The bit rate \( R_b \) is:

\[
R_b = \frac{1}{T_b} = \frac{1}{0.01 \times 10^{-6}} = 100 \, \text{Mbps}
\]

For BPSK, the null-to-null bandwidth (also called the first-null bandwidth) of the baseband signal is approximately:

\[

"In a binary system, if the bit error probability is 0.0001, what is the probability that a 20-bit word has exactly one error?","We are given:

- Bit error probability: \( p = 0.0001 = 10^{-4} \)
- Word length: \( n = 20 \) bits
- We want the probability of **exactly one error** in the 20-bit word.

This is a classic **binomial probability** problem.

The binomial probability formula is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
\]

For exactly one error (\( k = 1 \)):

\[
P(1) = \binom{20}{1} (0.0001)^1 (1 - 0.0001)^{19}
\]

Break it down:

- \( \binom{20}{1} = 20 \)
- \( p = 0.0001 \)
- \( 1 - p = 0.9999 \)
- So:
\[
P(1) = 20 \times 0.0001 \times (0.9999)^{19}
\]

Now compute \( (0.9999)^{19} \). Since \( 0.9999 \) is very close to 1, we can use the approximation:

\[
(1 - x)^n \approx 1 - nx \quad \text{for small } x
\]

Let \( x = 0.0001 \), \( n = 19 \):

\[
(0.9999)^{19} \approx 1 - 19 \times 0.0001 = 1 - 0.0019 = 0.9981
\]

So,

\[
P(1) \approx 20 \times 0.0001 \times 0.9981 = 0.002 \times 0.9981 = 0.0019962
\]

Therefore, the probability that a 20-bit word has exactly one error is approximately:

\[
\boxed{0.001996}
\]

Or, more precisely, you could calculate \( (0.9999)^{19} \) directly using a calculator:

\[
(0.9999)^{19} \approx 0.9981005

Then:

\[
P(1) = 20 \times 0.0001 \times 0.9981005 = 0.001996201

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Bit Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}
\]

However, the problem gives us the **symbol rate** (5 MBaud), not the bit rate directly. To proceed, we need to know how many bits are carried per symbol — that is, the number of bits per symbol (log₂(M) for M-QAM or similar modulation).

But since this information isn't given, we must assume the simplest case: **one bit per symbol**, which corresponds to a binary modulation like BPSK.

Then:
- Symbol rate = 5 MBaud = 5 × 10⁶ symbols/second
- If 1 bit/symbol → Bit rate = 5 Mbps

Now, bandwidth = 4 MHz = 4 × 10⁶ Hz

So,

\[

\log_2(63.0957) = \frac{\log_{10}(63.0957)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{1.8000}{0.3010} \approx 5.98

\]

Given the probabilities:

  \( -0.3 \log_2(0.3) \)

- For \( p = 0.2 \):  
  \( -0.2 \log_2(0.2) \)

Let’s compute numerically:

First, recall:
- \( \log_2(0.3) \approx \frac{\ln(0.3)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-1.20397}{0.6931} \approx -1.736 \)
- So, \( -0.3 \times (-1.736) \approx 0.5208 \)

Similarly:
- \( \log_2(0.2) \approx \frac{\ln(0.2)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-1.6094}{0.6931} \approx -2.3219 \)

### Step 1: Compute \( H(0.35) \)

\[

We compute each term:

- \( \log_2 0.35 = \frac{\ln 0.35}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-1.0498}{0.6931} \approx -1.515 \)
- So, \( -0.35 \log_2 0.35 \approx -0.35 \times (-1.515) = 0.530 \)

- \( \log_2 0.65 = \frac{\ln 0.65}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.4308}{0.6931} \approx -0.621 \)

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 70-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 70-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of the Fourier transform (spectrum) of the pulse drops by 70 dB from its peak value.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Fourier Transform of a Rectangular Pulse**:
   The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) centered at 0 is:
   \[
   \text{rect}(t/T) \xrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} T \cdot \text{sinc}(\pi f T)
   \]
   where:
   \[
   \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x}
   \]

2. **Magnitude Response**:
   The magnitude of the spectrum is:
   \[
   |X(f)| = |T \cdot \text{sinc}(\pi f T)| = T \left| \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \right|
   \]
   The peak occurs at \( f = 0 \), where \( |X(0)| = T \).

3. **70-dB Drop**:
   A 70-dB drop means the power is reduced by a factor of \( 10^{70/10} = 10^7 \), and since power is proportional to the square of magnitude, the magnitude drops by \( \sqrt{10^7} = 10^{3.5} = 3162.28 \) (approximately).

   So we solve for \( f \) such that:
   \[
   \left| \text{sinc}(\pi f T) \right| = \frac{1}{10^{3.5}} = 10^{-3.5}
   \]

4. **Solving for \( f \)**:
   Let \( x = \pi f T \). Then:
   \[
   \left| \frac{\sin x}{x} \right| = 10^{-3.5}
   \]
   This equation must be solved numerically or using approximations.

   For small values of \( x \), \( \sin x \approx x - x^3/6 \), but here \( x \) is not small — we need the first zero crossing of the sinc function and beyond, where it decays slowly.

   Numerical solution shows that the first time \( |\text{sinc}(x)| = 10^{-3.5} \) occurs at approximately:
   \[
   x \approx 9.5
   \]
   (This is based on known behavior: the sinc function decays as \( 1/x \), and the magnitude reaches \( 10^{-3.5} \) around \( x \approx 9.5 \)).

5. **Convert back to frequency**:
   \[
   x = \pi f T = 9.5 \Rightarrow f = \frac{9.5}{\pi T}
   \]

   The 70-dB bandwidth is the full width between the two points where the magnitude drops to 70 dB below the peak — so it's symmetric about \( f = 0 \). Hence, the total bandwidth is:
   \[
   B_{70\text{dB}} = 2f = \frac{2 \times 9.5}{\pi T} = \frac{19}{\pi T}
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   \[
   \boxed{\frac{19}{\pi T}}
   \]

\[
H = \log_2(131072)

Because:
- \( 2^{10} = 1024 \)
- \( 2^{17} = 2^{10} \times 2^7 = 1024 \times 128 = 131072 \)

"For a matched filter, if the input signal energy is 8 μJ and noise PSD N0=8×10^{-12} W/Hz, what is the output SNR (linear)?","To calculate the output Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for a matched filter, we use the following formula:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = \frac{2E}{N_0}
\]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the input signal (in joules),
- \( N_0 \) is the noise power spectral density (in W/Hz),
- The factor of 2 comes from the matched filter's optimal performance in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).

Given:
- Signal energy \( E = 8 \, \mu\text{J} = 8 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{J} \)
- Noise PSD \( N_0 = 8 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

Now plug into the formula:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = \frac{2 \times 8 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^{-12}} = \frac{16 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^{-12}} = 2 \times 10^{6}

  \]

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 0, i.e., \( P(Y=0) \).

---

### Step-by-step solution:

The output \( Y \) depends on the input \( X \) and the channel behavior.

Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Y=0) = P(Y=0 | X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=0 | X=1)P(X=1)
\]

In a BSC:
- \( P(Y=0 | X=0) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52 \) (no error)
- \( P(Y=0 | X=1) = p = 0.48 \) (error: 1 flipped to 0)

Substitute values:

\[
P(Y=0) = (0.52)(0.5) + (0.48)(0.5)

- For Hamming codes in general, the minimum distance is always **3**.
- This means:
  - The code can **detect up to 2 errors**.

\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 15 \, \text{MHz} = 15 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 25 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to a linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{25}{10}} = 10^{2.5} = 316.23

We can compute \( \log_2(316.23) \) using:

\[
\log_2(316.23) = \frac{\log_{10}(316.23)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{2.50}{0.3010} \approx 8.306

"In a binary system, if the bit error probability is 0.00005, what is the probability that a 100-bit word has no error?","We are given:

- Bit error probability: \( p = 0.00005 \)
- Word length: \( n = 100 \) bits
- We want the probability that **no errors occur** in the 100-bit word.

---

### Step-by-step:

The probability that a single bit is **correct** (no error) is:
\[
1 - p = 1 - 0.00005 = 0.99995
\]

Assuming independent bit errors, the probability that all 100 bits are correct is:
\[
P(\text{no errors}) = (1 - p)^{100} = (0.99995)^{100}
\]

Now compute this value:

We can use the approximation for small \( p \):
\[
(1 - p)^n \approx e^{-np}
\]
This is valid when \( p \) is small and \( n \) is moderate — which is the case here.

So:
\[
np = 100 \times 0.00005 = 0.005
\]
\[
P(\text{no errors}) \approx e^{-0.005} \approx 1 - 0.005 + \frac{(0.005)^2}{2!} - \cdots

\[
e^{-0.005} \approx 0.995012479
\]

Alternatively, compute directly:

A PCM system samples at 48 kHz and uses 20 bits per sample. What is the data rate (in Mbps)?,"To calculate the data rate of a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) system:

**Given:**
- Sampling rate = 48 kHz = 48,000 samples per second  
- Bits per sample = 20 bits

**Data rate (in bits per second):**  
\[
\text{Data rate} = \text{Sampling rate} \times \text{Bits per sample}
\]
\[

"For a raised-cosine filter with α=0.8, what is the absolute bandwidth if the symbol rate is 30 MBaud?","To calculate the absolute bandwidth of a raised-cosine filter, we use the formula:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( B \) = absolute bandwidth (in Hz),
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (in symbols per second, or Baud),
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor (0 ≤ α ≤ 1).

Given:
- \( R_s = 30 \) MBaud = \( 30 \times 10^6 \) Baud,
- \( \alpha = 0.8 \).

Plug in the values:

\[
B = \frac{30 \times 10^6}{2} (1 + 0.8) = 15 \times 10^6 \times 1.8 = 27 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}

"In a digital communication system, the symbol rate is 10 MBaud and the bandwidth is 8 MHz. What is the spectral efficiency (in bps/Hz)?","To calculate the **spectral efficiency** in **bps/Hz**, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Data Rate (bps)}}{\text{Bandwidth (Hz)}}
\]

We are given:
- Symbol rate = 10 MBaud = 10 × 10⁶ symbols per second
- Bandwidth = 8 MHz = 8 × 10⁶ Hz

But to find the data rate, we need to know how many bits per symbol are being transmitted. This is not directly given.

However, in many cases — especially in introductory or standardized problems — if no modulation scheme is specified, a common assumption is that each symbol carries **1 bit** (i.e., binary modulation like BPSK). 

So:
- If each symbol = 1 bit ⇒ Data Rate = 10 Mbps

Then:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{10 \times 10^6 \text{ bps}}{8 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}} = \frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

✅ **Answer: 1.25 bps/Hz**

Note: If more information about modulation (e.g., QPSK = 2 bits/symbol, 16-QAM = 4 bits/symbol) were given, the data rate and thus spectral efficiency would increase accordingly.

"For a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.04, what is the probability that the value is greater than 0.2?","We are given a Gaussian (normal) distribution with:

- Mean \( \mu = 0 \)
- Variance \( \sigma^2 = 0.04 \) → Standard deviation \( \sigma = \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2 \)

We want to find:

\[
P(X > 0.2)
\]

### Step 1: Standardize the variable
Convert to the standard normal variable \( Z \):

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{0.2 - 0}{0.2} = 1
\]

So,

\[
P(X > 0.2) = P(Z > 1)

### Step 2: Use standard normal table or calculator
From standard normal distribution tables or using a calculator:

\[
P(Z > 1) = 1 - P(Z \leq 1) = 1 - \Phi(1)

"A binary source emits symbols with probabilities P(0)=0.99, P(1)=0.01. What is the entropy (in bits per symbol)?","To calculate the **entropy** of a binary source, we use the formula:

\[
H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i
\]

For this binary source:
- \( P(0) = 0.99 \)
- \( P(1) = 0.01 \)

So the entropy is:

\[
H = -[P(0) \log_2 P(0) + P(1) \log_2 P(1)]
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
H = -[0.99 \log_2(0.99) + 0.01 \log_2(0.01)]
\]

Now compute each term:

1. \( \log_2(0.99) \approx \frac{\ln(0.99)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.01005}{0.6931} \approx -0.0145 \)

   So:  
   \( 0.99 \times \log_2(0.99) \approx 0.99 \times (-0.0145) \approx -0.014355 \)

2. \( \log_2(0.01) = \frac{\ln(0.01)}{\ln(2)} = \frac{-4.6052}{0.6931} \approx -6.644 \)

   So:

### Step 1: Compute \( H(0.38) \)

\[
H(0.38) = -0.38 \log_2 0.38 - 0.62 \log_2 0.62

First, compute the logarithms:

- \( \log_2 0.38 = \frac{\ln 0.38}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.9680}{0.6931} \approx -1.3967 \)

### Step 1: Convert dB to linear scale
The relationship between decibels and linear scale is:

\[
\gamma_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\gamma_{\text{dB}}}{10}}
\]

Given:
\[
\gamma_{\text{dB}} = 18 \, \text{dB}

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=2.5/T?","For a rectangular pulse of duration \( T \), the energy spectral density (ESD) is given by the squared magnitude of its Fourier transform.

The rectangular pulse is defined as:

The Fourier transform of this pulse is:

\]

Recall:

\[
\text{sinc}(2.5) = \frac{\sin(\pi \cdot 2.5)}{\pi \cdot 2.5} = \frac{\sin(2.5\pi)}{2.5\pi}
\]

Since \( \sin(2.5\pi) = \sin(\pi + 1.5\pi) = \sin(\pi + \pi/2) = \sin(3\pi/2) = -1 \),

\[
\text{sinc}(2.5) = \frac{-1}{2.5\pi} = -\frac{1}{2.5\pi}

"A source emits symbols with probabilities 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2. What is the entropy (in bits per symbol)?","We are given a source that emits 5 symbols, each with equal probability:

\[
P = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
\]

This is a uniform distribution over 5 symbols.

The entropy \( H \) of a discrete source is given by:

\[
H = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \log_2 p_i
\]

Since all probabilities are equal (\( p_i = 0.2 \)), we can simplify:

\[
H = -5 \times (0.2 \log_2 0.2)
\]

First, compute \( \log_2 0.2 \):

\[
\log_2 0.2 = \frac{\log_{10} 0.2}{\log_{10} 2} \approx \frac{-0.69897}{0.30103} \approx -2.3219

\[
H(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p)

Given:  
\( p = 0.45 \)

Step 1: Compute \( H(0.45) \)

\[
H(0.45) = -0.45 \log_2 0.45 - 0.55 \log_2 0.55

We can compute this using logarithms:

- \( \log_2 0.45 = \frac{\ln 0.45}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.7985}{0.6931} \approx -1.152 \)
- \( \log_2 0.55 = \frac{\ln 0.55}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.5978}{0.6931} \approx -0.862 \)

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 80-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 80-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the pulse is within 80 dB below its peak (i.e., at -80 dB relative to the maximum).

---

### Step 1: Fourier Transform of Rectangular Pulse

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \), centered at zero, is:

\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(\pi f T)
\]

where:
- \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \)
- The peak of the spectrum occurs at \( f = 0 \), where \( X(0) = T \)

So the magnitude is:
\[
|X(f)| = T \left| \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \right|
\]

---

### Step 2: Define 80-dB Bandwidth

We want the frequency \( f_{80} \) such that:

\[
20 \log_{10} \left( \frac{|X(f_{80})|}{|X(0)|} \right) = -80 \, \text{dB}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\left| \text{sinc}(\pi f_{80} T) \right| = 10^{-4}
\]

Because \( |X(f)| / |X(0)| = |\text{sinc}(\pi f T)| \), and we want this ratio to be \( 10^{-4} \).

So:
\[
\left| \frac{\sin(\pi f_{80} T)}{\pi f_{80} T} \right| = 10^{-4}
\]

Let \( x = \pi f_{80} T \). Then:
\[
\left| \frac{\sin x}{x} \right| = 10^{-4}
\]

This equation must be solved numerically for \( x \), then convert back to \( f_{80} \).

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

We solve:
\[
\left| \frac{\sin x}{x} \right| = 10^{-4}
\]

This occurs when \( \frac{\sin x}{x} \approx \pm 10^{-4} \). The first positive solution (after the main lobe) is approximately:

Using numerical methods or known approximations:
- For \( |\text{sinc}(x)| = 10^{-4} \), the first positive root occurs near \( x \approx 6.285 \)

More accurately, solving \( \frac{\sin x}{x} = 10^{-4} \) yields:
\[
x \approx 6.284
\]

(Since the sinc function oscillates, we’re looking for the first positive value where it reaches ±0.0001.)

---

### Step 4: Convert to Frequency

Recall \( x = \pi f_{80} T \), so:
\[
f_{80} = \frac{x}{\pi T} \approx \frac{6.284}{\pi T} \approx \frac{2}{T}
\]

(Since \( \frac{6.284}{\pi} \approx 2 \))

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The 80-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is approximately \( \frac{2}{T} \).**

In terms of \( \frac{1}{T} \), it’s:

"If the bit rate is 100 Mbps and the modulation is BPSK, what is the null-to-null bandwidth (in MHz)?","For Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), the null-to-null bandwidth is typically equal to the bit rate.

This is because BPSK uses one bit per symbol, so the symbol rate (baud rate) equals the bit rate. The null-to-null bandwidth of a BPSK signal in baseband is approximately equal to the symbol rate. When transmitted as a passband signal, the null-to-null bandwidth remains the same — it's centered at the carrier frequency but spans from \( f_c - R_s/2 \) to \( f_c + R_s/2 \), where \( R_s \) is the symbol rate.

"A binary symmetric channel has crossover probability 0.49. If the input symbols are equally likely, what is the probability of receiving a 1?","We are given a **binary symmetric channel (BSC)** with:

- Crossover probability \( p = 0.49 \)
- Input symbols are equally likely: \( P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 0.5 \)

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 1, i.e., \( P(Y=1) \).

---

### Step-by-step solution:

The output \( Y \) depends on the input \( X \) and the channel behavior.

Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Y=1) = P(Y=1|X=0)P(X=0) + P(Y=1|X=1)P(X=1)
\]

From the BSC model:
- \( P(Y=1|X=0) = p = 0.49 \) (crossover: 0 becomes 1)
- \( P(Y=1|X=1) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51 \) (no error: 1 stays 1)

Given \( P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 0.5 \), plug in:

\[
P(Y=1) = (0.49)(0.5) + (0.51)(0.5)
\]
\[
= 0.245 + 0.255 = 0.5

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
P(Y=1) = 0.5

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 6.02 \times b + 1.76
\]

where:
- \( b \) is the number of bits,
- The term \( 6.02 \times b \) accounts for the signal power increasing linearly with the number of bits (since each bit doubles the number of levels),

\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 20 \) MHz = \( 20 \times 10^6 \) Hz
- SNR = 30 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{30}{10}} = 10^3 = 1000
\]

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 20 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 1000) = 20 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1001)
\]

We can approximate \( \log_2(1001) \). Since \( \log_2(1024) = 10 \), and 1001 is very close to 1024:

\[
\log_2(1001) \approx \frac{\ln(1001)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{6.90875}{0.6931} \approx 9.966

"For BPSK, if the bit duration is 0.002 μs, what is the null-to-null bandwidth (in MHz)?","For BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), the null-to-null bandwidth is determined by the bit rate and the modulation scheme.

### Step 1: Determine Bit Rate
Bit duration \( T_b = 0.002 \, \mu\text{s} = 2 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \)

Bit rate \( R_b = \frac{1}{T_b} = \frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 500 \times 10^6 \, \text{bps} = 500 \, \text{Mbps} \)

### Step 2: Null-to-Null Bandwidth for BPSK
For standard BPSK with rectangular pulses, the spectrum has its first nulls at:
\[
f = \frac{1}{T_b} = R_b
\]

So the **null-to-null bandwidth** is:
\[
B_{\text{null-to-null}} = 2 \times \frac{R_b}{2} = R_b
\]
Wait — let’s be precise.

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of duration \( T_b \) has nulls at multiples of \( \frac{1}{T_b} \). For a baseband BPSK signal (before carrier modulation), the power spectral density has its first nulls at:
\[
f = \pm \frac{1}{T_b}
\]
Therefore, the **null-to-null bandwidth** is:
\[
B = \frac{2}{T_b} = 2 \times R_b
\]

But wait! That's not quite right either — confusion arises from baseband vs. passband.

Actually:

- The **baseband BPSK signal** (after pulse shaping with rectangular pulses) has a sinc-shaped spectrum.
- Its first nulls occur at \( f = \pm \frac{1}{T_b} = \pm R_b \).
- So the **null-to-null bandwidth** is from \( -R_b \) to \( +R_b \), which is:
\[
B = 2R_b
\]

✅ But this is for the **baseband** signal.

However, in many contexts — especially in digital communications — when they ask for ""null-to-null bandwidth"" for BPSK, they mean the **minimum bandwidth** required to transmit the signal without ISI, i.e., the bandwidth from first null to first null in the baseband spectrum.

So if \( R_b = 500 \, \text{Mbps} \), then:

\[
\text{Null-to-null bandwidth} = 2 \times \frac{1}{T_b} = 2 \times R_b = 2 \times 500 = 1000 \, \text{MHz}
\]

Wait — that can't be right because \( \frac{1}{T_b} = R_b = 500 \, \text{MHz} \), so from \(-500\) MHz to \(+500\) MHz, the total width is:
\[
500 - (-500) = 1000 \, \text{MHz}
\]

✅ Correct!

"In a binary system, if the bit error probability is 0.00001, what is the probability that a 50-bit word has exactly one error?","We are given:

- Bit error probability: \( p = 0.00001 = 10^{-5} \)
- Word length: \( n = 50 \) bits
- We want the probability of **exactly one error** in the 50-bit word.

This is a classic binomial probability problem.

### Binomial Probability Formula:
The probability of exactly \( k \) errors in \( n \) bits is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
\]

Here, \( k = 1 \), so:

\[
P(1) = \binom{50}{1} p^1 (1 - p)^{49}
\]

Now compute step by step:

1. \( \binom{50}{1} = 50 \)
2. \( p = 10^{-5} \)
3. \( 1 - p = 1 - 10^{-5} = 0.99999 \)

So,

\[
P(1) = 50 \times 10^{-5} \times (0.99999)^{49}
\]

Now compute \( (0.99999)^{49} \). Since \( p \) is small, we can approximate using the exponential approximation:

\[
(1 - p)^{n} \approx e^{-np} \quad \text{for small } p
\]

Here, \( np = 50 \times 10^{-5} = 0.0005 \), so:

\[
(0.99999)^{49} \approx e^{-0.0005} \approx 1 - 0.0005 + \frac{(0.0005)^2}{2!} \approx 0.999500125

\[
(0.99999)^{49} \approx 0.9995001249875...

Now plug in:

\[

"In a digital communication system, the symbol rate is 20 MBaud and the bandwidth is 16 MHz. What is the spectral efficiency (in bps/Hz)?","To calculate the **spectral efficiency** in bits per second per hertz (bps/Hz), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Data Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}
\]

However, the problem gives us the **symbol rate** (20 MBaud = 20 × 10⁶ symbols/second), not the data rate directly. To compute the spectral efficiency, we need to know how many bits are transmitted per symbol — that is, the modulation scheme's bit/symbol ratio.

But since the problem does not specify the modulation or the number of bits per symbol, we must assume a standard case unless told otherwise.

In many contexts, if no specific modulation is mentioned, and only symbol rate and bandwidth are given, sometimes it’s assumed that the system achieves **Nyquist rate** transmission — meaning the symbol rate equals the bandwidth for a baseband signal, which would imply a spectral efficiency of 1 bps/Hz for binary signaling.

However, here we have:
- Symbol rate = 20 MBaud
- Bandwidth = 16 MHz

The symbol rate is higher than the bandwidth — this suggests that the system is using **bandpass modulation** and/or some kind of pulse shaping (like raised cosine), and possibly efficient spectral usage.

Importantly, **spectral efficiency** can also be computed as:

\[
\eta = \frac{R_s}{B}
\]

where:
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (in symbols/sec)
- \( B \) = bandwidth (in Hz)

This gives the **spectral efficiency in symbols/second/Hz**, but to get **bps/Hz**, we need to multiply by the number of bits per symbol (\( \log_2 M \)) if the modulation is M-ary.

Since we don't have information about the modulation order (e.g., QPSK, 16-QAM, etc.), we cannot determine the exact number of bits per symbol.

BUT — if the problem is asking for the **maximum possible spectral efficiency** under ideal conditions (i.e., assuming the symbol rate matches the bandwidth), then we might interpret it differently.

Wait! Actually, in digital communications, the maximum achievable spectral efficiency for a given bandwidth depends on the modulation. But if no modulation is specified, we may be expected to compute the **symbol rate / bandwidth** as a lower bound or nominal value — but this is not correct for bps/Hz.

Let’s clarify:

If we assume **binary signaling (M=2)**, then each symbol carries 1 bit → Data Rate = 20 Mbps  
Then:

\[
\eta = \frac{20 \times 10^6 \text{ bps}}{16 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}} = 1.25 \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

But again, this is only true if the modulation is binary (e.g., BPSK).

Alternatively, if this is a general question where ""symbol rate"" is used and no modulation is specified, the answer might expect:

\[
\eta = \frac{\text{Symbol Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}} = \frac{20 \text{ MBaud}}{16 \text{ MHz}} = \frac{20}{16} = 1.25 \text{ Baud/Hz}
\]

But that is **symbols/second/Hz**, not bits/second/Hz.

So we must conclude: without knowing the number of bits per symbol, we cannot give a definitive answer in **bps/Hz**.

However, in many standardized problems like this, especially in exams or textbooks, when they ask for spectral efficiency given symbol rate and bandwidth — and no modulation — they often mean:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency (bps/Hz)} = \frac{\text{Symbol Rate (Baud)}}{\text{Bandwidth (Hz)}}
\]

only if one assumes 1 bit per symbol.

So, using that assumption:

\[
\eta = \frac{20 \times 10^6}{16 \times 10^6} = 1.25 \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

"For a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 9, what is the probability that the value is between -3 and 3?","We are given a Gaussian (normal) distribution with:

- Mean $ \mu = 0 $
- Variance $ \sigma^2 = 9 $ → so standard deviation $ \sigma = 3 $

We want to find the probability that a value lies between -3 and 3, i.e.,  
$$
P(-3 < X < 3)
$$

### Step 1: Standardize the values
Convert to z-scores using:
$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

For $ x = -3 $:
$$
z = \frac{-3 - 0}{3} = -1
$$

For $ x = 3 $:
$$
z = \frac{3 - 0}{3} = 1
$$

So we need:
$$
P(-1 < Z < 1)
$$
where $ Z \sim N(0,1) $, the standard normal distribution.

### Step 2: Use standard normal table or known values
From standard normal distribution tables or calculator:
- $ P(Z < 1) \approx 0.8413 $
- $ P(Z < -1) \approx 0.1587 $

So:
$$
P(-1 < Z < 1) = P(Z < 1) - P(Z < -1) = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$

"A binary source emits symbols with probabilities P(0)=0.999, P(1)=0.001. What is the entropy (in bits per symbol)?","To calculate the **entropy** of a binary source, we use the formula for entropy in bits:

\[
H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i
\]

For a binary source with:
- \( P(0) = 0.999 \)
- \( P(1) = 0.001 \)

The entropy is:

\[
H = -[P(0) \log_2 P(0) + P(1) \log_2 P(1)]
\]

Plug in the values:

\[
H = -[0.999 \log_2(0.999) + 0.001 \log_2(0.001)]

We'll compute each term:

1. \( \log_2(0.999) \approx \frac{\ln(0.999)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.0010005}{0.6931} \approx -0.001443 \)

   So:  
   \( 0.999 \times (-0.001443) \approx -0.001441 \)

2. \( \log_2(0.001) = \log_2(10^{-3}) = -3 \log_2(10) \approx -3 \times 3.3219 = -9.9657 \)

   So:  
   \( 0.001 \times (-9.9657) = -0.0099657 \)

Now add them:

\[
H = -(-0.001441 - 0.0099657) = 0.0114067 \text{ bits per symbol}

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=3/T?","To find the **energy spectral density (ESD)** of a rectangular pulse at frequency \( f = \frac{3}{T} \), we follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Define the Rectangular Pulse**
Let the rectangular pulse be:

\[
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & |t| \leq \frac{T}{2} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

This is a pulse of amplitude \( A \) and duration \( T \).

---

### 2. **Energy Spectral Density (ESD)**
The ESD is given by the squared magnitude of the Fourier Transform of \( x(t) \):

\[
S_{xx}(f) = |X(f)|^2
\]

where \( X(f) \) is the Fourier transform of \( x(t) \).

---

### 3. **Fourier Transform of Rectangular Pulse**
The Fourier transform of the rectangular pulse is:

\[
X(f) = A T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]

where \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \)

So,

\[
|X(f)|^2 = A^2 T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(fT)
\]

Thus, the energy spectral density is:

\[
S_{xx}(f) = A^2 T^2 \cdot \left( \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \right)^2
\]

---

### 4. **Evaluate at \( f = \frac{3}{T} \)**

Plug in \( f = \frac{3}{T} \):

\[
S_{xx}\left(\frac{3}{T}\right) = A^2 T^2 \cdot \left( \frac{\sin(\pi \cdot \frac{3}{T} \cdot T)}{\pi \cdot \frac{3}{T} \cdot T} \right)^2
= A^2 T^2 \cdot \left( \frac{\sin(3\pi)}{3\pi} \right)^2

Now:
- \( \sin(3\pi) = 0 \)

So the entire expression becomes:

\[
S_{xx}\left(\frac{3}{T}\right) = A^2 T^2 \cdot \left( \frac{0}{3\pi} \right)^2 = 0

A channel has bandwidth 5000 kHz and SNR 40 dB. What is the Shannon capacity (in Mbps)?,"To calculate the **Shannon capacity**, we use the formula:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (as a linear value, not in dB)

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 5000 \) kHz = \( 5000 \times 10^3 \) Hz = 5,000,000 Hz
- SNR = 40 dB

First, convert SNR from dB to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{40}{10}} = 10^4 = 10,000
\]

Now plug into Shannon’s formula:

\[
C = 5,000,000 \times \log_2(1 + 10,000) = 5,000,000 \times \log_2(10,001)
\]

We approximate \( \log_2(10,001) \). Since \( 10,001 \approx 10^4 \), and \( \log_2(10^4) = 4 \log_2(10) \approx 4 \times 3.3219 = 13.2876 \)

More accurately:
\[
\log_2(10,001) \approx \log_2(10000) = \log_2(10^4) = 4 \times \log_2(10) \approx 4 \times 3.321928 = 13.2877

Given probabilities:  
\( p_1 = 0.1 \),  
\( p_2 = 0.2 \),

where \( H(p) \) is the binary entropy function:

\[
H(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p)
\]

Given:  
\( p = 0.48 \)

First, compute \( H(0.48) \):

\[
H(0.48) = -0.48 \log_2 0.48 - 0.52 \log_2 0.52
\]

We calculate each term:

- \( \log_2 0.48 = \frac{\ln 0.48}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.734}{0.6931} \approx -1.059 \)
- So, \( -0.48 \times (-1.059) \approx 0.508 \)

- \( \log_2 0.52 = \frac{\ln 0.52}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.653}{0.6931} \approx -0.942 \)

What is the bandwidth of a DSB-SC signal if the modulating signal has bandwidth 35 kHz?,"The bandwidth of a Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB-SC) signal is **twice the bandwidth of the modulating signal**.

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 90-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 90-dB bandwidth of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) refers to the frequency range over which the power spectral density (PSD) of the pulse is within 90 dB of its peak value.

The Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is a sinc function:
\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT) = T \cdot \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T}
\]
The magnitude squared (power spectral density) is:
\[
|X(f)|^2 = T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(fT)
\]

The peak occurs at \( f = 0 \), where \( |X(0)|^2 = T^2 \).

A 90-dB bandwidth means we are looking for the frequencies where:
\[
10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{|X(f)|^2}{|X(0)|^2} \right) = -90 \, \text{dB}
\]
So:
\[
\frac{|X(f)|^2}{|X(0)|^2} = 10^{-9} = 10^{-9}
\]

Since \( |X(0)|^2 = T^2 \), this gives:
\[
\text{sinc}^2(fT) = 10^{-9}
\]
Taking square roots:
\[
|\text{sinc}(fT)| = 10^{-4.5} \approx 3.162 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Now, solve:
\[
\frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} = \pm 3.162 \times 10^{-5}
\]

For small \( x = \pi f T \), we can approximate \( \sin(x)/x \approx 1 - x^2/6 \). But since we want the first zero-crossing of the sinc function where it drops significantly, we instead rely on known values or numerical solution.

It's known that the first sidelobe of the sinc function is about −13.26 dB below the main lobe, and the 90-dB point lies deep in the tail of the sinc function — well beyond the first zero crossing at \( f = 1/T \).

To find the exact frequency, we solve:
\[
\text{sinc}(x) = 10^{-4.5}, \quad \text{where } x = \pi f T
\]

This requires solving numerically:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{x} = 3.162 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Using numerical methods or lookup tables, the solution for \( x \) such that \( \frac{\sin x}{x} = 10^{-4.5} \) is approximately:
\[
x \approx 4.5 \pi \quad \text{(this is an approximation; actual solution needs better estimate)}
\]

But more accurately, the first root of \( \text{sinc}(x) = 10^{-4.5} \) occurs around:
\[
x \approx 4.48 \pi \quad \text{(numerically solved)}
\]

Thus:
\[
\pi f T \approx 4.48 \pi \Rightarrow f \approx 4.48 / T
\]

Therefore, the **90-dB bandwidth** is approximately:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4.48}{T}}
\]

This is the frequency range from \( -4.48/T \) to \( +4.48/T \), so the total 90-dB bandwidth is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8.96}{T}}

"A binary symmetric channel has crossover probability 0.499. If the input symbols are equally likely, what is the probability of receiving a 1?","We are given:

- A binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probability \( p = 0.499 \).
- Input symbols are equally likely, so \( P(X = 0) = P(X = 1) = 0.5 \).

We are asked to find the probability of receiving a 1, i.e., \( P(Y = 1) \).

---

### Step-by-step:

In a BSC:
- If the input is 0, the output is 1 with probability \( p \), and 0 with probability \( 1 - p \).
- If the input is 1, the output is 0 with probability \( p \), and 1 with probability \( 1 - p \).

Using the law of total probability:

\[
P(Y = 1) = P(Y = 1 | X = 0)P(X = 0) + P(Y = 1 | X = 1)P(X = 1)
\]

Substitute known values:
- \( P(Y = 1 | X = 0) = p = 0.499 \)
- \( P(Y = 1 | X = 1) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.499 = 0.501 \)
- \( P(X = 0) = P(X = 1) = 0.5 \)

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 30 \, \text{MHz} = 30 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 35 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to linear scale:

\[

- Bit error probability: \( p = 0.000001 = 10^{-6} \)
- Word length: \( n = 1000 \)
- We want the probability of **exactly one error** in the 1000-bit word.

This is a classic binomial probability problem.

### Binomial Probability Formula:
The probability of exactly \( k \) errors in \( n \) bits is:

\[
P(k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}
\]

For \( k = 1 \), this becomes:

\[
P(1) = \binom{1000}{1} p^1 (1 - p)^{999}
\]

Now compute each part:

1. \( \binom{1000}{1} = 1000 \)
2. \( p = 10^{-6} \)
3. \( (1 - p)^{999} \approx e^{-999p} \) — using the approximation \( (1 - p)^n \approx e^{-np} \) for small \( p \)

So:

\[
P(1) \approx 1000 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot e^{-999 \cdot 10^{-6}}
\]

First, compute the exponent:

\[
999 \cdot 10^{-6} = 0.000999

Then:

\[
e^{-0.000999} \approx 1 - 0.000999 + \frac{(0.000999)^2}{2} \approx 0.999001

"In a digital communication system, the symbol rate is 50 MBaud and the bandwidth is 40 MHz. What is the spectral efficiency (in bps/Hz)?","To calculate the **spectral efficiency** in bits per second per hertz (bps/Hz), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Bit Rate}}{\text{Bandwidth}}
\]

However, in this problem, we’re given the **symbol rate** (also called baud rate), not the bit rate directly. To find the bit rate, we need to know how many bits are transmitted per symbol — which is typically determined by the modulation scheme.

But since the modulation scheme isn't specified, we must assume the simplest case: **one bit per symbol**, i.e., binary modulation (like BPSK).

So:
- Symbol rate = 50 MBaud = 50 × 10⁶ symbols/second
- If 1 bit/symbol → Bit rate = 50 Mbps
- Bandwidth = 40 MHz = 40 × 10⁶ Hz

Now compute spectral efficiency:

\[
\text{Spectral Efficiency} = \frac{50 \times 10^6 \text{ bps}}{40 \times 10^6 \text{ Hz}} = \frac{50}{40} = 1.25 \text{ bps/Hz}
\]

✅ **Answer**: **1.25 bps/Hz**

Note: If a higher-order modulation were used (e.g., QPSK = 2 bits/symbol, 16-QAM = 4 bits/symbol), the spectral efficiency would be higher. But without such information, 1 bit/symbol is the standard assumption for basic calculation.",1.25,0.0,0.02789205000000001
"For a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 0.01, what is the probability that the value is less than -0.1?","We are given a Gaussian (normal) distribution with:

- Mean μ = 0  
- Variance σ² = 0.01 → Standard deviation σ = √0.01 = 0.1

We want to find the probability that a value X is less than -0.1:

\[
P(X < -0.1)
\]

### Step 1: Standardize the variable
Convert to the standard normal variable Z:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{-0.1 - 0}{0.1} = -1
\]

So,

\[
P(X < -0.1) = P(Z < -1)
\]

### Step 2: Use the standard normal table or known values
From standard normal distribution tables or using a calculator:

\[
P(Z < -1) = \Phi(-1) \approx 0.1587
\]

(Alternatively, since the standard normal is symmetric, \( P(Z < -1) = P(Z > 1) \), and \( P(-1 < Z < 1) \approx 0.6827 \), so the tails each have about 0.1587.)

"A binary source emits symbols with probabilities P(0)=0.9999, P(1)=0.0001. What is the entropy (in bits per symbol)?","To calculate the entropy \( H \) of a binary source, we use the formula:

\[
H = -\sum_{i} p_i \log_2 p_i
\]

For a binary source with probabilities:
- \( P(0) = 0.9999 \)
- \( P(1) = 0.0001 \)

The entropy is:

\[
H = -[P(0) \log_2 P(0) + P(1) \log_2 P(1)]
\]

Let’s compute each term:

1. \( P(0) \log_2 P(0) = 0.9999 \cdot \log_2(0.9999) \)

Since \( \log_2(0.9999) \approx \frac{\ln(0.9999)}{\ln(2)} \), and using the approximation \( \ln(1 - x) \approx -x \) for small \( x \):

- \( \ln(0.9999) \approx -0.0001 \)
- So \( \log_2(0.9999) \approx \frac{-0.0001}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.0001}{0.6931} \approx -0.0001443 \)

Then:
\[
P(0) \log_2 P(0) \approx 0.9999 \times (-0.0001443) \approx -0.0001443
\]

2. \( P(1) \log_2 P(1) = 0.0001 \cdot \log_2(0.0001) \)

\( \log_2(0.0001) = \log_2(10^{-4}) = -4 \log_2(10) \approx -4 \times 3.3219 = -13.2876 \)

So:
\[
P(1) \log_2 P(1) = 0.0001 \times (-13.2876) = -0.00132876

- They can correct 1 bit error
- This requires a minimum Hamming distance of 3

For the (31,26) Hamming code:
- Length n = 31 (total bits)
- Data bits k = 26
- Parity bits r = 5 (since 2^r ≥ n + 1 → 2^5 = 32 ≥ 32)

"For a sinusoidal modulating signal, what is the modulation index if the carrier amplitude is 200 V and the sideband amplitude is 80 V?","To find the **modulation index** (often denoted as \( m \)) for a sinusoidal modulating signal, we use the relationship between the sideband amplitude and the carrier amplitude in amplitude modulation (AM).

For standard AM:

\[

where \( H(p) \) is the binary entropy function:

\[
H(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p)
\]

Given:
- \( p = 0.46 \)

First, compute \( H(0.46) \):

\[
H(0.46) = -0.46 \log_2 0.46 - 0.54 \log_2 0.54
\]

We’ll calculate each term numerically:

- \( \log_2 0.46 = \frac{\ln 0.46}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.7765}{0.6931} \approx -1.120 \)
- So: \( -0.46 \times (-1.120) \approx 0.515 \)

- \( \log_2 0.54 = \frac{\ln 0.54}{\ln 2} \approx \frac{-0.6162}{0.6931} \approx -0.889 \)

"For a rectangular pulse of duration T, what is the energy spectral density at f=4/T?","To find the energy spectral density (ESD) of a rectangular pulse at a specific frequency \( f = \frac{4}{T} \), we follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Rectangular Pulse Definition**
Let the rectangular pulse be:
\[
x(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & |t| \leq \frac{T}{2} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
This has duration \( T \), amplitude \( A \), and is centered at \( t = 0 \).

---

### 2. **Fourier Transform of Rectangular Pulse**
The Fourier transform of \( x(t) \) is:
\[
X(f) = A T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]
where \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \)

Note: Some definitions use \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \), so be consistent — here, \( \text{sinc}(fT) = \frac{\sin(\pi f T)}{\pi f T} \).

---

### 3. **Energy Spectral Density (ESD)**
The ESD is:
\[
S_x(f) = |X(f)|^2
\]

So:
\[
S_x(f) = \left| A T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT) \right|^2 = A^2 T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(fT)
\]

---

### 4. **Evaluate at \( f = \frac{4}{T} \)**

Plug in \( f = \frac{4}{T} \):
\[
S_x\left(\frac{4}{T}\right) = A^2 T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2\left( \frac{4}{T} \cdot T \right) = A^2 T^2 \cdot \text{sinc}^2(4)
\]

Now compute \( \text{sinc}(4) \):
\[
\text{sinc}(4) = \frac{\sin(\pi \cdot 4)}{\pi \cdot 4} = \frac{\sin(4\pi)}{4\pi} = \frac{0}{4\pi} = 0

### Entropy of a uniform source:
The entropy per symbol (in bits) for a uniform distribution over \( N \) symbols is:

\[
H = \log_2(4194304)

Given the symbol probabilities:  
\( p_1 = 0.05 \),  
\( p_2 = 0.1 \),  
\( p_3 = 0.15 \),  
\( p_4 = 0.2 \),  
\( p_5 = 0.5 \)

We compute each term:

1. \( 0.05 \log_2(0.05) = 0.05 \times \log_2(1/20) = 0.05 \times (-\log_2 20) \approx 0.05 \times (-4.3219) = -0.2161 \)

2. \( 0.1 \log_2(0.1) = 0.1 \times \log_2(1/10) = 0.1 \times (-\log_2 10) \approx 0.1 \times (-3.3219) = -0.3322 \)

3. \( 0.15 \log_2(0.15) \approx 0.15 \times \log_2(0.15) = 0.15 \times (-2.737) \approx -0.4106 \)

"For a binary symmetric channel, if the error probability is 0.499, what is the channel capacity (in bits per use)?","For a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probability \( p \), the channel capacity \( C \) in bits per use is given by:

\[
C = 1 - H(p)
\]

where \( H(p) \) is the binary entropy function:

\[
H(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p)
\]

Given:
- \( p = 0.499 \)

Now compute \( H(0.499) \):

Since \( p = 0.499 \) is very close to 0.5, and the binary entropy function is symmetric around 0.5 and maximized at \( p = 0.5 \), we know:

\[
H(0.5) = 1
\]

So for \( p = 0.499 \), \( H(p) \) is just slightly less than 1.

Let’s compute it numerically:

\[
H(0.499) = -0.499 \log_2(0.499) - 0.501 \log_2(0.501)
\]

First, compute the logs:

- \( \log_2(0.499) = \frac{\ln(0.499)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.695}{0.6931} \approx -1.0027 \)
- \( \log_2(0.501) = \frac{\ln(0.501)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.691}{0.6931} \approx -0.9969 \)

Now plug in:

\[
H(0.499) = -0.499 \times (-1.0027) - 0.501 \times (-0.9969)
= 0.499 \times 1.0027 + 0.501 \times 0.9969
\]

Calculate each term:

- \( 0.499 \times 1.0027 \approx 0.5003 \)
- \( 0.501 \times 0.9969 \approx 0.4994 \)

Sum:  
\( H(0.499) \approx 0.5003 + 0.4994 = 0.9997 \)

Therefore, the channel capacity is:

"For a rectangular pulse of width T, what is the 100-dB bandwidth (in terms of 1/T)?","The 100-dB bandwidth refers to the frequency range over which the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the pulse is within 100 dB (i.e., a factor of 10⁻⁵) of its peak value.

For a rectangular pulse of width \( T \), the Fourier transform is:

\[
X(f) = T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)
\]

where \( \text{sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \).

The peak occurs at \( f = 0 \), where \( X(0) = T \).

We want the frequency \( f \) such that:
\[
|X(f)| = 10^{-5} \cdot |X(0)| = 10^{-5} T
\]

So:
\[
|T \cdot \text{sinc}(fT)| = 10^{-5} T
\]
\[
|\text{sinc}(fT)| = 10^{-5}
\]

Let \( x = fT \). Then:
\[
|\text{sinc}(x)| = 10^{-5}
\]

We solve for \( x \) such that:
\[
\left| \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right| = 10^{-5}
\]

This equation must be solved numerically. The first positive solution for \( x \) (since sinc is symmetric) can be approximated from known values or using root-finding methods.

It is known that the first zero-crossing of sinc(x) is at \( x = 1 \), and the amplitude decays slowly. The value of \( x \) where \( |\text{sinc}(x)| = 10^{-5} \) corresponds roughly to:

\[
x \approx \frac{2.4048}{\pi} \approx 0.765 \quad \text{(not quite)}
\]

Actually, we need to solve:
\[
\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} = \pm 10^{-5}
\]

The first maximum after the main lobe is around \( x \approx 1.43 \), but the rapid decay implies that the 100-dB point occurs at much larger \( x \). A standard result in communications and signal processing literature states:

> For a rectangular pulse, the 100-dB bandwidth (i.e., the frequency where the power drops by 100 dB relative to the peak) is approximately:
\[
f_{100\text{-dB}} \approx \frac{2.4}{T}
\]

More precisely (from numerical solutions):

- Solve \( |\text{sinc}(x)| = 10^{-5} \).
- This gives \( x \approx 2.4048 \) as the first positive solution (since the first sidelobe of sinc(x) reaches about -13 dB, then successive lobes decrease).

Wait — actually, let’s clarify:

- At \( x = 1 \), sinc(1) ≈ 0.0000001 (very small), but the main lobe goes from 0 to 1.
- To find where the magnitude falls to \( 10^{-5} \), we use numerical methods.

From standard references (e.g., Proakis & Salehi, or MATLAB/Python solving):

The solution to \( \left| \frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x} \right| = 10^{-5} \) has its first positive root near:

\[
x \approx 2.4
\]

Thus,
\[
f T = 2.4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad f = \frac{2.4}{T}
\]

Therefore, the **100-dB bandwidth** of a rectangular pulse of width \( T \) is approximately:

\[
\boxed{\frac{2.4}{T}}

"A binary symmetric channel has crossover probability 0.5. If the input symbols are equally likely, what is the mutual information I(X;Y)?","We are given:

- A **binary symmetric channel (BSC)** with crossover probability \( p = 0.5 \).
- Input symbols \( X \in \{0, 1\} \) are equally likely: \( P(X=0) = P(X=1) = 0.5 \).

We are to compute the **mutual information** \( I(X; Y) \), which measures how much information about \( X \) is contained in \( Y \).

---

### Step 1: Understand the BSC
In a BSC with crossover probability \( p \), the channel behaves as:
- \( P(Y = x | X = x) = 1 - p \)
- \( P(Y \neq x | X = x) = p \)

With \( p = 0.5 \), this means:
- The output \( Y \) is completely independent of the input \( X \).  
Because regardless of what \( X \) is, \( Y \) will be 0 or 1 with equal probability.

So the channel is ""completely noisy"".

---

### Step 2: Compute Mutual Information

Mutual information is defined as:
\[
I(X; Y) = \sum_{x} \sum_{y} P(x, y) \log \left( \frac{P(x, y)}{P(x)P(y)} \right)
\]

But easier here is to use:
\[
I(X; Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)
\]

#### Step 2a: Compute \( H(Y|X) \)

Given \( X \), the output \( Y \) is Bernoulli(0.5) because:
- If \( X = 0 \), then \( Y = 0 \) with prob 0.5 and \( Y = 1 \) with prob 0.5
- Similarly if \( X = 1 \)

So, for any \( x \), \( H(Y|X=x) = H(0.5) = 1 \) bit.

Thus,
\[
H(Y|X) = \sum_x P(x) H(Y|X=x) = 0.5 \cdot 1 + 0.5 \cdot 1 = 1 \text{ bit}
\]

#### Step 2b: Compute \( H(Y) \)

What is the distribution of \( Y \)?

Since \( X \) is uniform and the channel flips bits with probability 0.5, the output \( Y \) will also be uniform:
- \( P(Y = 0) = P(X=0)P(Y=0|X=0) + P(X=1)P(Y=0|X=1) \)
- \( = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \)

Similarly, \( P(Y = 1) = 0.5 \)

So \( Y \sim \text{Bernoulli}(0.5) \), hence:
\[
H(Y) = H(0.5) = 1 \text{ bit}
\]

#### Step 2c: Compute \( I(X;Y) \)
\[
I(X;Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X) = 1 - 1 = 0 \text{ bits}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
I(X;Y) = 0

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 50 \) MHz = \( 50 \times 10^6 \) Hz

First, convert SNR from decibels to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{60}{10}} = 10^6

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 50 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 10^6)

Since \( 10^6 \gg 1 \), we can approximate:
\[
\log_2(1 + 10^6) \approx \log_2(10^6)

And:
\[
\log_2(10^6) = 6 \log_2(10) \approx 6 \times 3.32193 = 19.9316
