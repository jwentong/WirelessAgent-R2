Channel capacity with SNR=0.5 (linear) and bandwidth B=1 MHz. Compute C in Mbit/s.,"To compute the channel capacity \( C \), we use **Shannon's Channel Capacity Formula**:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB),
- \( C \) is the channel capacity in bits per second.

Given:
- \( B = 1 \, \text{MHz} = 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( \text{SNR} = 0.5 \)

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 10^6 \log_2(1 + 0.5) = 10^6 \log_2(1.5)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(1.5) \):

\[
\log_2(1.5) = \frac{\log_{10}(1.5)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.1761}{0.3010} \approx 0.585
\]

So:

\[
C \approx 10^6 \times 0.585 = 585,000 \, \text{bits per second} = 0.585 \, \text{Mbit/s}

Free-space constant K=(λ/(4πd0))^2 with d0=1 m. For f_c=1 GHz compute K.,"We are given:

- Free-space constant:  
  \[
  K = \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_0} \right)^2
  \]
- Frequency \( f_c = 1 \, \text{GHz} = 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)
- Reference distance \( d_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \)

### Step 1: Compute the wavelength \( \lambda \)
The wavelength in free space is:
\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c}
\]
where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is the speed of light.

\[
\lambda = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{10^9} = 0.3 \, \text{m}
\]

### Step 2: Plug into the formula for K
\[
K = \left( \frac{0.3}{4\pi \cdot 1} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{0.3}{4\pi} \right)^2
\]

First compute \( \frac{0.3}{4\pi} \):
\[
\frac{0.3}{4\pi} \approx \frac{0.3}{12.5664} \approx 0.02387
\]

Now square it:
\[
K \approx (0.02387)^2 \approx 5.70 \times 10^{-4}
\]

"For coherent OOK with A=1, N0=0.5, P1=0.2, P2=0.8, compute V_T.","To compute the optimal threshold voltage \( V_T \) for coherent On-Off Keying (OOK) with given parameters, we use the maximum likelihood decision rule based on the received signal statistics.

Given:
- Amplitude of signal when ""1"" is transmitted: \( A = 1 \)
- Noise power spectral density: \( N_0 = 0.5 \)
- Probability of transmitting ""1"": \( P_1 = 0.2 \)
- Probability of transmitting ""0"": \( P_0 = 0.8 \)

In coherent OOK:
- When ""1"" is sent, the received signal is \( r = A + n \), where \( n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{N_0}{2}) \)
- When ""0"" is sent, \( r = 0 + n \)

The optimal threshold \( V_T \) minimizes the total probability of error and is given by the **likelihood ratio test**:

\[
\frac{p(r|1)}{p(r|0)} \overset{1}{\underset{0}{\gtrless}} \frac{P_0}{P_1}
\]

Taking log-likelihood ratio:

\[
\ln \left( \frac{p(r|1)}{p(r|0)} \right) \overset{1}{\underset{0}{\gtrless}} \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)
\]

The likelihoods are Gaussian:
- \( p(r|1) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi N_0}} \exp\left( -\frac{(r - A)^2}{N_0} \right) \)
- \( p(r|0) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi N_0}} \exp\left( -\frac{r^2}{N_0} \right) \)

So the log-likelihood ratio is:

\[
\frac{(r - A)^2 - r^2}{N_0} \leq \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)
\]

Simplify numerator:

\[
(r^2 - 2Ar + A^2) - r^2 = -2Ar + A^2
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{-2Ar + A^2}{N_0} \leq \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)
\]

Multiply both sides by \( N_0 \):

\[
-2Ar + A^2 \leq N_0 \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)
\]

Solve for \( r \):

\[
-2Ar \leq N_0 \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right) - A^2
\]
\[
r \geq \frac{A^2 - N_0 \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)}{2A}
\]

Therefore, the optimal threshold is:

\[
V_T = \frac{A^2 - N_0 \ln \left( \frac{P_0}{P_1} \right)}{2A}
\]

Now plug in values:
- \( A = 1 \)
- \( N_0 = 0.5 \)
- \( P_0 = 0.8 \), \( P_1 = 0.2 \), so \( \frac{P_0}{P_1} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \)

So:

\[
V_T = \frac{1^2 - 0.5 \cdot \ln(4)}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{1 - 0.5 \cdot \ln(4)}{2}
\]

Compute \( \ln(4) = \ln(2^2) = 2 \ln 2 \approx 2 \cdot 0.6931 = 1.3862 \)

Then:

\[
V_T = \frac{1 - 0.5 \cdot 1.3862}{2} = \frac{1 - 0.6931}{2} = \frac{0.3069}{2} = 0.15345

- The error probability is modeled as:
  \[
  P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)
  \]
- We are to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Use the given equation
We are told:
\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 10^{-2}
\]

Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}
\]
Then:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-2}
\]

We now solve for \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 0.01 \).

---

### Step 2: Invert the Q-function

The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

From standard tables or using a calculator/software, we know:
\[
Q^{-1}(0.01) \approx 2.326
\]

This means:
\[
x = 2.326 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = 2.326
\]

---

### Step 3: Square both sides
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = (2.326)^2 \approx 5.41

---

### Step 4: Convert to dB

"For RC shaping with α=0.3 and bandwidth 41.6 kHz, find max QPSK bit rate.","To find the maximum QPSK bit rate for an RC (Root Raised Cosine) filter with roll-off factor α = 0.3 and bandwidth B = 41.6 kHz, follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship
For a Root Raised Cosine filter, the symbol rate \( R_s \) is related to the system bandwidth \( B \) by:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

This equation comes from the fact that the total occupied bandwidth of a raised cosine filter (including both sides of the spectrum) is:
\[
B = R_s \cdot \frac{(1 + \alpha)}{2}
\]
Wait — correction: the correct formula is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\quad \text{or} \quad 
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

✅ Yes — this is the standard relation.

---

### Step 2: Plug in known values

- Bandwidth \( B = 41.6 \) kHz
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.3 \)

So,

\[
R_s = \frac{2 \times 41.6}{1 + 0.3} = \frac{83.2}{1.3} = 64 \text{ ksym/s}

Energy of s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Compute E.,"We are given a signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

where:
- \( A \) is a constant (amplitude),
- \( U(t) \) is the unit step function,
- \( T \) is a positive constant.

This signal represents a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \).

---

### Step 1: Understand the Signal
The expression \( U(t) - U(t - T/3) \) is a rectangular pulse that is:
- 1 for \( 0 \leq t < T/3 \),
- 0 elsewhere.

So, \( s(t) = A \) for \( 0 \leq t < T/3 \), and 0 otherwise.

---

### Step 2: Compute Energy
The energy \( E \) of a continuous-time signal \( s(t) \) is defined as:

\[
E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |s(t)|^2 \, dt
\]

Since \( s(t) \) is nonzero only on \( [0, T/3] \), we can write:

\[
E = \int_0^{T/3} |A|^2 \, dt = |A|^2 \int_0^{T/3} dt = |A|^2 \cdot \frac{T}{3}
\]

Assuming \( A \) is real (as no complex notation is used), \( |A|^2 = A^2 \). So:

\[
E = A^2 \cdot \frac{T}{3}

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( R_s = 2 \times 10^6 \) baud (symbol rate)
- \( A = 2 \) mV = \( 2 \times 10^{-3} \) V (received amplitude)
- \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \) W/Hz (double-sided noise power spectral density)

We’re also told:
- \( E_b = \frac{A^2}{4R_s} \)
- \( N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} \) (since \( N_0 \) is the single-sided noise PSD)

---

### Step 1: Compute \( E_b \)

\[
E_b = \frac{A^2}{4R_s} = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-3})^2}{4 \times 2 \times 10^6}
= \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^6}
= \frac{4}{8} \times 10^{-12}
= 0.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{J}
\]

So,
\[
E_b = 5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( N_0 \)

\[
N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

Note: Since \( N_0 \) has units of W/Hz, and \( E_b \) is in J (which is W·s), the ratio \( E_b/N_0 \) will be dimensionless — as required.

---

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-13}}{5 \times 10^{-11}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( P_b = Q(\sqrt{0.01}) = Q(0.1) \)

The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt

A PM signal is s(t)=5 cos(2π·2 MHz·t + 3 cos(2π·5 kHz·t)). Find the maximum phase deviation.,"We are given a Phase Modulated (PM) signal:

\[
s(t) = 5 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 2 \text{ MHz} \cdot t + 3 \cos(2\pi \cdot 5 \text{ kHz} \cdot t)\right)
\]

This is in the standard form of a PM signal:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + k_p m(t)\right)
\]

Where:
- \( A_c = 5 \) (amplitude),
- \( f_c = 2 \text{ MHz} \) (carrier frequency),
- \( k_p \) is the phase sensitivity,
- \( m(t) = \cos(2\pi \cdot 5 \text{ kHz} \cdot t) \) is the message signal.

In the given expression, the phase deviation term is:
\[

\]

This means that the phase deviation function is:
\[

DBPSK over AWGN. Find required E_b/N_0 (in dB) for BER P_b=10^{-6}.,"To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) for a DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) system over an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 10^{-6} \), we use the well-known BER expression for DBPSK.

---

### ✅ BER for DBPSK over AWGN:
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

This formula assumes coherent detection of the differential signal and is valid for high SNR.

---

### 🔍 Given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-6}
\]

Set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right) = 10^{-6}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right) = 2 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:
\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-6}) = \ln(2) - 6 \ln(10)
\]

Use approximate values:
- \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 0.693 - 6 \times 2.3026 = 0.693 - 13.8156 = -13.1226
\]
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 13.1226

Now convert to dB:
\[

### Step 1: Plug in the value
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2 \times 20}\right) = Q\left(\sqrt{40}\right)

Calculate \( \sqrt{40} \):
\[
\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10} \approx 2 \times 3.1623 = 6.3246
\]

So:
\[
P_b = Q(6.3246)
\]

### Step 2: Estimate \( Q(6.3246) \)

The Q-function decreases rapidly for large arguments. For values above ~4, we can use approximations or standard tables.

From standard Q-function tables or a calculator:
- \( Q(6.0) \approx 9.87 \times 10^{-10} \)
- \( Q(6.3246) \) is even smaller.

Using a more precise approximation or calculator:
\[

A QPSK system uses raised-cosine with α=1 and must fit B=100 kHz. Find maximum bit rate.,"To find the maximum bit rate for a QPSK system using a raised-cosine filter with roll-off factor α = 1 and total bandwidth B = 100 kHz, we follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the relationship between bandwidth and symbol rate**

For a raised-cosine filter, the required bandwidth B is related to the symbol rate \( R_s \) by:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Given:
- \( B = 100 \text{ kHz} \)
- \( \alpha = 1 \)

Plug into the formula:

\[
100 \times 10^3 = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + 1) = \frac{R_s}{2} \cdot 2 = R_s
\]

So,

\[
R_s = 100 \text{ kbps}
\]

This is the **symbol rate**.

---

### **Step 2: Convert symbol rate to bit rate**

QPSK transmits **2 bits per symbol**, so:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 100 \text{ kbps} = 200 \text{ kbps}
\]

"Shannon capacity. B=50 MHz, SNR=0.1 (linear). Compute C (Mbps).","To compute the Shannon capacity \( C \), we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) is the channel capacity in bits per second (bps),
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB).

Given:
- \( B = 50 \, \text{MHz} = 50 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \),
- \( \text{SNR} = 0.1 \) (linear).

Plug into the formula:

TDM multiplexing. A TDM link supports symbol rate R_s=9.6×10^6 baud (assume 1 bit/symbol). Each of l analog channels has f_H=3 kHz and is PCM encoded with n=8 bits/sample at Nyquist. How many channels l can be multiplexed?,"We are given:

- Symbol rate of the TDM link: \( R_s = 9.6 \times 10^6 \) baud (1 bit per symbol)
- Each analog channel has bandwidth \( f_H = 3 \) kHz
- PCM encoding uses \( n = 8 \) bits/sample
- Sampling at Nyquist rate for each channel

---

### Step 1: Determine the sampling rate per channel

Nyquist rate = \( 2 \times f_H = 2 \times 3 \text{ kHz} = 6 \text{ kHz} \)

So, each channel is sampled at 6,000 samples per second.

---

### Step 2: Calculate bit rate per channel

Each sample is encoded with 8 bits ⇒  
Bit rate per channel = \( 6000 \text{ samples/sec} \times 8 \text{ bits/sample} = 48,000 \text{ bits/sec} = 48 \text{ kbps} \)

---

### Step 3: Total available bit rate from TDM link

Since each symbol carries 1 bit, the total bit rate = \( R_s = 9.6 \times 10^6 \text{ bps} = 9.6 \text{ Mbps} \)

---

### Step 4: Number of channels that can be multiplexed

Each channel requires 48 kbps.

So, number of channels \( l \):

\[
l = \frac{\text{Total bit rate}}{\text{Bit rate per channel}} = \frac{9.6 \times 10^6}{48 \times 10^3}

---

### Given:
- Mean of received power in dBm: μ = -70 dBm  
- Standard deviation (shadowing spread): σ = 7 dB  
- Threshold (required signal level): P_th = -80 dBm  

Outage occurs when the received power falls below the threshold. So, outage probability is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(P_r < P_{\text{th}})
\]

Since \( P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \), we can standardize:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)

We are asked to find \( A_0 \) such that the **clipping probability is 5%**, i.e.,

\[
P_r(r > A_0) = 0.05

### Step-by-step solution:

Set up the equation:

\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.05

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.05)

Compute capacity C1.","To compute the capacity \( C_1 \) for User 1 in a two-user uplink where User 1 is decoded first (i.e., successive decoding with User 1 first), we use the **Shannon capacity formula** for an interference-aware channel.

- Power of User 2: \( P_2 = 5 \, \text{mW} \)
- Noise power: \( N = 1 \, \text{mW} \)
- Bandwidth: \( B = 20 \, \text{MHz} \)

Since User 1 is decoded first, it treats the signal from User 2 as interference. Therefore, the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for User 1 is:

For p(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T)] passed through its matched filter, at what time does the output reach maximum?","For a pulse signal p(t) = A[U(t) - U(t - T)], which is a rectangular pulse of amplitude A and duration T (starting at t = 0), the matched filter output reaches its maximum at:

**t = T**

### Explanation:
The matched filter for a signal p(t) is designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the moment when the entire signal has been received — that is, at the end of the signal duration.

- The matched filter impulse response is h(t) = p(T - t), a time-reversed and delayed version of p(t).
- When p(t) is passed through its matched filter, the output y(t) = p(t) * h(t) = p(t) * p(T - t) is the autocorrelation of p(t) evaluated at lag τ = t - T/2 or similar, but importantly, it peaks when the entire signal aligns with the filter's ""template"".

For the rectangular pulse p(t) = A[U(t) - U(t - T)]:
- The convolution (filter output) reaches its peak when the input pulse has fully entered the filter — i.e., at t = T.
- This is because the matched filter correlates the input with the known signal shape, and the peak occurs when the full signal matches the template exactly.

✅ So, the output of the matched filter reaches its maximum at **t = T**.",t = T,0.8,0.00267185

- \( n = 22 \) (number of bits in the sync pattern)
- \( p = 10^{-4} = 0.0001 \) (bit error rate of the channel)
- \( m = 0 \) (no errors allowed — meaning all bits must match for a successful sync)

We are to compute the **miss probability**:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx 1 - (1 - p)^n
\]

### Step-by-step calculation:

First, compute \( (1 - p)^n \):

\[
(1 - p)^n = (1 - 0.0001)^{22} = (0.9999)^{22}
\]

We can use the approximation for small \( p \):

\[
(1 - p)^n \approx e^{-np}
\]

So,

\[
np = 22 \times 0.0001 = 0.0022
\]

Then,

\[
(1 - p)^n \approx e^{-0.0022}
\]

Now compute \( e^{-0.0022} \):

Using a calculator or Taylor expansion:

\[
e^{-0.0022} \approx 1 - 0.0022 + \frac{(0.0022)^2}{2} \approx 1 - 0.0022 + 0.00000242 \approx 0.99780242

"Compute mean received power needed for outage 0.5%. Threshold 15 dBm, σ=4 dB.","To compute the **mean received power needed for a 0.5% outage probability**, given:

- Outage probability \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.5\% = 0.005 \)
- Threshold power \( P_{\text{th}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)

---

### Step-by-step:

This is a classic problem in wireless communications involving **log-normal shadowing**.

The received power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
where \( \mu \) is the mean (in dB), and \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \).

The outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \). So we want:
\[
P(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = 0.005
\]

In terms of the standard normal variable \( Z \):
\[
P(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = P\left( \frac{\log_{10}(P_r) - \mu}{\sigma} < \frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
= \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
But since we’re working in **dB units**, it's more convenient to express everything in dB directly (i.e., use \( P_r \) in dBm):

Let \( X = P_r \) (in dBm), which is normally distributed with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma = 4 \).

Then:
\[
P(X < 15) = 0.005
\Rightarrow \Phi\left( \frac{15 - \mu}{4} \right) = 0.005
\]

Now solve for \( \mu \):

From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF:
\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.005) \approx -2.5758
\]

So:
\[
\frac{15 - \mu}{4} = -2.5758 \\

### Step 1: Use the DSB-SC relation

Given:
\[
\frac{S_o}{N_o} = 2 \cdot \frac{S_i}{N_i}
\]

Plug in known values:
\[
500 = 2 \cdot \frac{5000}{N_i}
\]

Solve for \( N_i \):
\[
500 = \frac{10000}{N_i} \Rightarrow N_i = \frac{10000}{500} = 20 \, \text{W}
\]

So the input noise power is \( N_i = 20 \, \text{W} \)

---

### Step 2: Relate \( N_i \) to \( P_n \)

From the problem statement:
\[
N_i = 2 P_n f_m
\]

Substitute \( N_i = 20 \, \text{W} \), \( f_m = 4000 \, \text{Hz} \):

\[
20 = 2 \cdot P_n \cdot 4000
\]

Solve for \( P_n \):

\[
20 = 8000 \cdot P_n \Rightarrow P_n = \frac{20}{8000} = 0.0025 \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

---

Gray-coded QPSK required E_b/N_0. Target BER P_b=2×10^{-6}. Find E_b/N_0 in dB (use Q^{-1}(2e-6)≈4.61).,"To find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB for Gray-coded QPSK with a target BER \( P_b = 2 \times 10^{-6} \), we use the known BER formula for Gray-coded QPSK:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

We are given:
- Target BER: \( P_b = 2 \times 10^{-6} \)
- \( Q^{-1}(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 4.61 \)

### Step 1: Set up the equation
From the BER formula:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 2 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Take the inverse Q-function of both sides:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = Q^{-1}(2 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 4.61
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.61
\]
Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.61)^2 = 21.2521
\]

Then:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{21.2521}{2} = 10.626
\]

### Step 3: Convert to dB
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(10.626) \approx 10 \times 1.026 = 10.26 \, \text{dB}

\[
s(t) = A_c \left(1 + \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t)\right) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

with:
- \( A_c = 4 \, \text{V} \)
- \( \mu = 0.6 \)

We are to find the magnitudes of the impulses in the Fourier transform \( S(f) \) at frequencies:
- \( \pm f_c \)
- \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Use trigonometric identity

Expand the AM signal using the product-to-sum identity:

\[
\cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \right]

So,

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \right]
\]

Simplify:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t)
\]

---

### Step 2: Take the Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform of \( \cos(2\pi f_0 t) \) is:
\[
\mathcal{F}\{\cos(2\pi f_0 t)\} = \frac{1}{2} [\delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0)]
\]

Apply this to each term:

1. **Carrier component** \( A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) \):
   \[
   \Rightarrow \frac{A_c}{2} [\delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c)]
   \]

2. **Upper sideband** \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) \):
   \[
   \Rightarrow \frac{A_c \mu}{4} [\delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m))]
   \]

3. **Lower sideband** \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \):
   \[
   \Rightarrow \frac{A_c \mu}{4} [\delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c - f_m))]
   \]

---

### Step 3: Combine all components

The spectrum \( S(f) \) consists of impulses at:
- \( \pm f_c \): magnitude from carrier
- \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \): magnitudes from sidebands

Now compute the magnitudes:

#### At \( \pm f_c \):

Magnitude = \( \frac{A_c}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{V} \)

#### At \( \pm (f_c + f_m) \) and \( \pm (f_c - f_m) \):

Matched filter output time for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-3T/4)]. Matched filter uses h(t)=s(T-t). At what time does output peak?,"We are given:

- Pulse signal:  
  \( s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U(t - \frac{3T}{4}) \right] \),  
  which is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \) starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).

- Matched filter impulse response:  
  \( h(t) = s(T - t) \)

We are to find the time at which the output of the matched filter peaks.

---

### Key Concept:
The output of a matched filter is the **cross-correlation** of the input signal with the filter's impulse response. For a matched filter, this cross-correlation peaks at the time when the input signal aligns perfectly with the reversed and delayed version of itself — that is, at the **end of the signal duration**.

More precisely, for a signal \( s(t) \) defined over \( [0, T_s] \), the matched filter output \( y(t) \) peaks at \( t = T_s \), where \( T_s \) is the duration of the signal.

In our case:

- The signal \( s(t) \) exists from \( t = 0 \) to \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \). So its duration is \( \frac{3T}{4} \).
- Therefore, the matched filter output will peak at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).

✅ **Answer: The output peaks at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \)**

---

### Optional Verification via Correlation:
Matched filter output:  
\( y(t) = s(t) * h(t) = s(t) * s(T - t) \)

This is equivalent to:  
\( y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) s(T - (t - \tau)) \, d\tau \)  
= \( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s(\tau) s(T - t + \tau) \, d\tau \)

This is the correlation of \( s(\tau) \) with a shifted version of itself.

The correlation function peaks when the two signals fully overlap — i.e., when \( t = \text{duration of } s(t) = \frac{3T}{4} \).

So again, the peak occurs at \( t = \frac{3T}{4} \).",t = T,0.8,0.006802700000000001
Rayleigh clipping model exp(-A0^2). Find A0 for clipping probability 0.5%.,"To find the value of \( A_0 \) for a clipping probability of 0.5% in the Rayleigh clipping model given by:

\[
P_{\text{clip}} = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

We are told that the clipping probability is 0.5%, which in decimal form is:

\[
P_{\text{clip}} = 0.005
\]

### Step 1: Set up the equation
\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.005
\]

### Step 2: Take the natural logarithm of both sides
\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.005)
\]

\[
A_0^2 = -\ln(0.005)
\]

### Step 3: Compute the logarithm
\[
\ln(0.005) \approx \ln(5 \times 10^{-3}) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^{-3}) = \ln(5) - 3\ln(10)
\]

Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(5) \approx 1.6094 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
\ln(0.005) \approx 1.6094 - 3 \times 2.3026 = 1.6094 - 6.9078 = -5.2984
\]

Therefore:
\[
A_0^2 = 5.2984
\]

### Step 4: Take the square root
\[
A_0 = \sqrt{5.2984} \approx 2.302
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:

"Compute Laplacian noise MAP threshold. Noiseless outputs are 0 or A with equal priors, noise Laplacian with parameter λ. Find threshold and P_e in terms of A and λ.","We are given a binary hypothesis testing problem with:

- Noiseless outputs: \( x \in \{0, A\} \) (equal priors, so \( P(0) = P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \))
- Observed signal: \( y = x + n \), where \( n \sim \text{Laplace}(0, \lambda) \)
- PDF of Laplacian noise:  
  \[
  f_n(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|n|}{\lambda}}
  \]

We want to find:

1. **MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) threshold** for deciding between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \)
2. **Probability of error \( P_e \)** in terms of \( A \) and \( \lambda \)

---

### Step 1: Likelihoods under each hypothesis

Let the observation be \( y \). The likelihoods are:

- Under \( H_0 \): \( x = 0 \Rightarrow y = n \sim \text{Laplace}(0, \lambda) \)
  \[
  f_{Y|H_0}(y) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|y|}{\lambda}}
  \]

- Under \( H_1 \): \( x = A \Rightarrow y = A + n \sim \text{Laplace}(A, \lambda) \)
  \[
  f_{Y|H_1}(y) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|y - A|}{\lambda}}
  \]

Because priors are equal (\( P(H_0) = P(H_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)), the MAP rule reduces to comparing the likelihoods:
\[
\text{Decide } H_1 \text{ if } f_{Y|H_1}(y) > f_{Y|H_0}(y)
\]
or equivalently:
\[
\frac{f_{Y|H_1}(y)}{f_{Y|H_0}(y)} > 1
\]

Compute the log-likelihood ratio (LLR):

\[
\log \left( \frac{f_{Y|H_1}(y)}{f_{Y|H_0}(y)} \right) 
= \log \left( \frac{e^{-\frac{|y - A|}{\lambda}}}{e^{-\frac{|y|}{\lambda}}} \right) 
= \frac{|y| - |y - A|}{\lambda}
\]

So decide \( H_1 \) (i.e., \( x = A \)) if:
\[
|y| - |y - A| > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |y| > |y - A|
\]

This inequality defines the MAP decision rule.

---

### Step 2: Find the threshold

We need to solve \( |y| = |y - A| \) to find the boundary point (threshold).

Assume \( A > 0 \) (which is reasonable since it's a positive amplitude).

Case analysis:

#### Case 1: \( y \geq A \)  
Then \( |y| = y \), \( |y - A| = y - A \) → \( y > y - A \) ⇒ always true ⇒ decide \( H_1 \)

#### Case 2: \( 0 \leq y < A \)  
Then \( |y| = y \), \( |y - A| = A - y \)  
Compare: \( y \overset{?}{>} A - y \Rightarrow 2y > A \Rightarrow y > \frac{A}{2} \)

#### Case 3: \( y < 0 \)  
Then \( |y| = -y \), \( |y - A| = A - y \)  
Compare: \( -y \overset{?}{>} A - y \Rightarrow 0 > A \) — false ⇒ decide \( H_0 \)

So overall, the decision rule is:

- Decide \( H_1 \) (x = A) if \( y > \frac{A}{2} \)
- Decide \( H_0 \) (x = 0) if \( y < \frac{A}{2} \)

**Threshold: \( \tau = \frac{A}{2} \)**

---

### Step 3: Compute Probability of Error \( P_e \)

Since priors are equal, we have:
\[
P_e = \frac{1}{2} P(\text{error}|H_0) + \frac{1}{2} P(\text{error}|H_1)
\]

Where:
- \( P(\text{error}|H_0) = P(y > \tau | H_0) = P(y > \frac{A}{2} | x=0) \)
- \( P(\text{error}|H_1) = P(y < \tau | H_1) = P(y < \frac{A}{2} | x=A) \)

Under \( H_0 \), \( y \sim \text{Laplace}(0, \lambda) \), so:
\[
P(y > \tfrac{A}{2}) = \int_{A/2}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-\frac{|y|}{\lambda}} dy
\]
Since \( y > 0 \), \( |y| = y \), so:
\[
= \frac{1}{2\lambda} \int_{A/2}^{\infty} e^{-y/\lambda} dy = \frac{1}{2\lambda} \cdot \left[ -\lambda e^{-y/\lambda} \right]_{A/2}^\infty = \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)}
\]

Under \( H_1 \), \( y \sim \text{Laplace}(A, \lambda) \), so:
\[
P(y < \tfrac{A}{2}) = \int_{-\infty}^{A/2} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda} dy
\]

Split into two parts because \( y < A \) (since \( A/2 < A \)), so \( |y - A| = A - y \):
\[
= \int_{-\infty}^{A/2} \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-(A - y)/\lambda} dy
= \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-A/\lambda} \int_{-\infty}^{A/2} e^{y/\lambda} dy
\]

Now compute:
\[
\int_{-\infty}^{A/2} e^{y/\lambda} dy = \lambda e^{A/(2\lambda)}
\]

So:
\[
P(y < \tfrac{A}{2} | H_1) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-A/\lambda} \cdot \lambda e^{A/(2\lambda)} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)}
\]

Thus, both conditional probabilities are equal:
\[
P(\text{error}|H_0) = P(\text{error}|H_1) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)}
\]

Therefore, total probability of error:
\[
P_e = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-A/(2\lambda)}
\]

Log-normal shadowing with σ=8 dB. Required threshold is 10 dBm. Find mean μ needed for outage 5%.,"We are given:

- Log-normal shadowing with standard deviation σ = 8 dB  
- Required threshold signal power: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \) dBm  
- Desired outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 5\% = 0.05 \)

We need to find the mean \( \mu \) (in dBm) of the log-normal distribution such that the probability the received power falls below the threshold is 5%.

---

### Step 1: Understand the model
The received signal power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
or in dB:
\[
X = 10 \log_{10}(P_r) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

The outage probability is:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = P(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = P(X < 10)
\]

This is equivalent to:
\[
P(Z < \frac{10 - \mu}{\sigma}) = 0.05
\]
where \( Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \).

---

### Step 2: Use standard normal table

Find the z-score corresponding to cumulative probability 0.05:

From standard normal tables:
\[
P(Z < z) = 0.05 \Rightarrow z \approx -1.645
\]

So:
\[
\frac{10 - \mu}{\sigma} = -1.645
\]

Plug in \( \sigma = 8 \):
\[
\frac{10 - \mu}{8} = -1.645
\]

Multiply both sides by 8:
\[
10 - \mu = -13.16

\[
\mu = 10 + 13.16 = 23.16 \, \text{dBm}

"For a 3000 Hz channel, compute spectral efficiency of 16PSK using η = 0.5 log2(M).","To compute the spectral efficiency of 16PSK (16-Phase Shift Keying) for a 3000 Hz channel, we use the formula:

\[
\eta = \frac{1}{2} \log_2(M)
\]

Where:
- \( \eta \) is the spectral efficiency in bits/second/Hz,
- \( M \) is the number of signal points in the constellation (for 16PSK, \( M = 16 \)).

### Step-by-step calculation:

1. Plug in \( M = 16 \):

\[
\eta = \frac{1}{2} \log_2(16)
\]

2. Since \( \log_2(16) = 4 \) (because \( 2^4 = 16 \)):

\[
\eta = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\eta = 2 \text{ bits/second/Hz}
\]

**Note:** The channel bandwidth (3000 Hz) does not affect the spectral efficiency in this context — it's a measure of how many bits per second can be transmitted per hertz of bandwidth, so it's independent of the actual channel width. Spectral efficiency is a normalized metric.

Compute coherent OOK threshold for equal priors when A=0.2 V.,"To compute the **coherent OOK (On-Off Keying) threshold** for equal priors when the signal amplitude \( A = 0.2 \, \text{V} \), we proceed as follows:

---

### 🔍 Problem Setup
In coherent OOK:
- Signal 1 (bit 1): \( s_1(t) = A \cdot p(t) \)
- Signal 0 (bit 0): \( s_0(t) = 0 \)
- The receiver uses a matched filter or correlation receiver.
- Noise is AWGN with two-sided power spectral density \( N_0/2 \).
- Prior probabilities are equal: \( P(0) = P(1) = 0.5 \).

The optimal decision threshold \( \eta \) for minimizing error probability under equal priors and coherent detection is:

\[
\eta = \frac{E_s}{2}
\]

where \( E_s \) is the energy per symbol.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Compute Symbol Energy \( E_s \)

Assuming a rectangular pulse shape of duration \( T \), the energy of the ""1"" symbol is:

\[
E_s = \int_0^T |s_1(t)|^2 dt = \int_0^T A^2 dt = A^2 T
\]

So,
\[
\eta = \frac{A^2 T}{2}
\]

But wait — this depends on \( T \). However, in many standard formulations (especially when comparing thresholds across systems), the threshold is often given **in terms of the received signal sample at the decision instant**, not absolute energy.

If the receiver integrates over one symbol period \( T \), then the output of the matched filter (or correlator) for bit 1 is:

\[
r_1 = A \sqrt{T} + n
\]
\[
r_0 = 0 + n
\]

Where \( n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2) \), and \( \sigma^2 = \frac{N_0}{2} \cdot T \) (noise variance after integration).

Then the optimal threshold for equal priors is the midpoint between the two means:

\[
\eta = \frac{r_1 + r_0}{2} = \frac{A \sqrt{T}}{2}
\]

This is the threshold in the **decision variable domain** — i.e., the value the receiver compares the sampled output to.

So depending on whether you want the threshold in terms of:
- **Energy**: \( \eta_E = \frac{A^2 T}{2} \)
- **Signal sample (matched filter output)**: \( \eta_{\text{sample}} = \frac{A \sqrt{T}}{2} \)

Both are valid, but the latter is more commonly used in practice.

---

### 🧮 Final Answer

Given \( A = 0.2 \, \text{V} \), and assuming a rectangular pulse of duration \( T \), the coherent OOK threshold for equal priors is:

\[
\boxed{\eta = \frac{A \sqrt{T}}{2} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \sqrt{T}}{2} = 0.1 \sqrt{T} \, \text{volts}}
\]

✅ This is the decision threshold in volts at the matched filter output for each symbol.

If you need a numerical value, you must provide \( T \).  
For example, if \( T = 1 \, \text{second} \), then \( \eta = 0.1 \, \text{V} \).",0.1,1.0,0.061151049999999985
"Compute miss probability for sync word allowing up to 1 error (m=1). Sync length n=40, channel BER p=10^{-5}. Approximate P_miss≈C(n,2)p^2.","We are asked to compute the **miss probability** for a synchronization word of length \( n = 40 \), allowing up to 1 error (i.e., sync word is considered ""detected"" if at most 1 bit is in error), with channel bit error rate \( p = 10^{-5} \).

The problem also gives an approximation:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

This approximation is valid when:
- The probability of more than one error is negligible,
- We're approximating the probability that **at least one error occurs**, but the sync word is still *not detected* — i.e., it's incorrect due to errors.

But note: The question implies we are computing the **probability that the sync word is missed**, meaning the receiver fails to detect it because of bit errors. If up to 1 error is allowed, then the sync word is accepted as long as there are 0 or 1 bit errors.

Therefore, the **miss probability** is the probability that there are **2 or more bit errors in the sync word** — which would cause the sync word to be rejected even though it might be correct (or not).

So:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} = P(\text{2 or more errors}) = 1 - P(0 \text{ errors}) - P(1 \text{ error})
\]

However, for small \( p \) and moderate \( n \), the dominant term in the tail of the binomial distribution (i.e., two or more errors) can be approximated by just the second-order term:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx \binom{n}{2} p^2
\]

This is a standard Poisson approximation or Taylor expansion idea where higher-order terms like \( p^3, p^4, \dots \) are negligible when \( p \ll 1 \).

Given:
- \( n = 40 \)
- \( p = 10^{-5} \)

Compute:

\[
\binom{40}{2} = \frac{40 \cdot 39}{2} = 780

Then:

\[
P_{\text{miss}} \approx 780 \times (10^{-5})^2 = 780 \times 10^{-10} = 7.8 \times 10^{-8}

Capacity of a 3.4 kHz telephone channel at output SNR 20 dB. Compute C (kbit/s).,"To compute the channel capacity \( C \) of a 3.4 kHz telephone channel with an output SNR of 20 dB, we use **Shannon's Channel Capacity Formula**:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity in bits per second (bps)
- \( B \) = bandwidth in Hz
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

---

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale

Given:
- SNR (dB) = 20 dB

Convert to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into Shannon’s formula

- Bandwidth \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3400 \, \text{Hz} \)
- SNR = 100

\[
C = 3400 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 3400 \times \log_2(101)
\]

We need \( \log_2(101) \). Use change of base:

\[
\log_2(101) = \frac{\log_{10}(101)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{2.0043}{0.3010} \approx 6.659

---

### Step 1: Solve the inequality

Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}
\]
So,
\[
Q(x) < 10^{-6}
\]

We want:
\[
x > Q^{-1}(10^{-6})
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q^{-1}(10^{-6}) \approx 4.753
\]

(You can confirm this with a Q-function inverse lookup or use Python's `scipy.stats.norm.ppf` — note that \( Q(x) = 1 - \Phi(x) \), so \( Q^{-1}(p) = \Phi^{-1}(1 - p) \).)

So:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} > 4.753
\]

### Step 2: Square both sides

\[
\frac{4E_b}{N_0} > (4.753)^2 \approx 22.59
\]

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} > \frac{22.59}{4} = 5.6475

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(5.6475) \approx 7.52 \text{ dB}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

### Step 2: Determine number of quantization levels
Each level is separated by Δ = 0.1 V.

If endpoints are included and the step size is constant, the number of levels \( L \) is:

PCM rate. An audio signal f_H=7 kHz is sampled at Nyquist and quantized with 12 bits/sample. Find R_b.,"To find the bit rate \( R_b \), we use the formula:

\[
R_b = f_s \times b
\]

Where:
- \( f_s \) = sampling rate (in samples per second),
- \( b \) = number of bits per sample.

---

### Step 1: Determine the sampling rate \( f_s \)

The signal has a highest frequency \( f_H = 7 \, \text{kHz} \).  
According to the **Nyquist criterion**, the sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency:

\[
f_s = 2 \times f_H = 2 \times 7 \, \text{kHz} = 14 \, \text{kHz}

"Minimum mean power for 1% outage. Threshold 10 dBm, σ=12 dB. Find μ.","We are given:

- A 1% outage probability (i.e., the probability that the received power falls below the threshold is 0.01).
- Threshold: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \) dBm
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 12 \) dB
- We are to find the mean \( \mu \) (in dBm) of the log-normal distribution such that the outage probability is 1%.

---

### Step 1: Understand the outage condition

In wireless communications, the received power \( P_r \) is often modeled as a log-normal random variable:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
or in dB:
\[
10 \log_{10}(P_r) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

Outage occurs when:
\[
P_r < P_{\text{th}} \Rightarrow 10 \log_{10}(P_r) < 10 \log_{10}(P_{\text{th}})
\]

Let \( X = 10 \log_{10}(P_r) \), so \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \)

The outage probability is:
\[
\Pr(X < P_{\text{th}}) = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.01
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( \mu \)

From:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{12} \right) = 0.01
\]

Take the inverse standard normal CDF (quantile function):
\[
\frac{10 - \mu}{12} = \Phi^{-1}(0.01)
\]

Find \( \Phi^{-1}(0.01) \):  
From standard normal tables or using a calculator:
\[
\Phi^{-1}(0.01) \approx -2.326
\]

Now solve:
\[
\frac{10 - \mu}{12} = -2.326

\[
10 - \mu = -2.326 \times 12 = -27.912

\[

- \( K = 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \)
- \( \gamma = 4 \)
- \( d_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \)
- \( d = 100 \, \text{m} \)

### Step-by-step calculation:

1. Compute the distance ratio:
\[
\frac{d_0}{d} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01
\]

2. Raise to the power γ = 4:
\[
\left(\frac{d_0}{d}\right)^4 = (0.01)^4 = 10^{-8}
\]

3. Multiply all terms:
\[
P_r = 10 \times 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \times 10^{-8}
\]

First, multiply constants:
\[
10 \times 5.70 \times 10^{-4} = 5.70 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Then:
\[
P_r = 5.70 \times 10^{-3} \times 10^{-8} = 5.70 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{mW}

---

### **Step 1: BER formula for Gray-coded QPSK over AWGN**

For Gray-coded QPSK, each symbol carries 2 bits, and because of Gray coding, the probability of a bit error is approximately half the symbol error rate. The BER for Gray-coded QPSK is given by:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

This is a standard result — the bit error rate for Gray-coded QPSK is equal to the Q-function evaluated at \( \sqrt{2E_b/N_0} \).

---

### **Step 2: Set up the equation**

We are given:
\[
P_b = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\]
So:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}
\Rightarrow Q(x) = 3 \times 10^{-5}
\]

Now solve for \( x \) using the inverse Q-function:
\[
x = Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5})
\]

---

### **Step 3: Use known values or approximate \( Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5}) \)**

From standard Q-function tables or using approximations:

- \( Q(4.26) \approx 1.08 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( Q(4.10) \approx 2.0 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( Q(4.05) \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( Q(4.04) \approx 2.7 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( Q(4.03) \approx 2.8 \times 10^{-5} \)

Interpolating between:
- \( Q(4.0) \approx 3.17 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( Q(4.05) \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-5} \)

We want \( Q(x) = 3 \times 10^{-5} \). So \( x \approx 4.02 \) to \( 4.04 \).

More precisely, using a calculator or software (e.g., MATLAB's `qfuncinv`):

\[
Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.03
\]

(Some sources use \( Q^{-1}(3 \times 10^{-5}) = 4.029 \))

Use:
\[
x \approx 4.03
\]

---

### **Step 4: Solve for \( E_b/N_0 \)**

Recall:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \Rightarrow \frac{2E_b}{N_0} = x^2
\]
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{x^2}{2} = \frac{(4.03)^2}{2} = \frac{16.2409}{2} \approx 8.12045
\]

Convert to dB:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(8.12045) \approx 10 \times 0.9097 \approx 9.10 \text{ dB}

"A baseband system must transmit R_b=4000 bit/s through a telephone channel with B_avail=3100 Hz. Using raised-cosine shaping, what maximum roll-off α is allowable for QPSK?","To determine the maximum roll-off factor α allowable for QPSK in a baseband system, we use the relationship between the bit rate, bandwidth, and the roll-off factor.

For a raised-cosine filter, the required bandwidth \( B \) is given by:

\[
B = \frac{R_b}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( R_b \) = bit rate = 4000 bit/s  
- \( B \) = available bandwidth = 3100 Hz  
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor (0 ≤ α ≤ 1)

We solve for \( \alpha \):

\[
3100 = \frac{4000}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

\[
3100 = 2000 (1 + \alpha)
\]

Divide both sides by 2000:

\[
\frac{3100}{2000} = 1 + \alpha
\]

\[
1.55 = 1 + \alpha

\[
\alpha = 0.55

✅ **Answer:** The maximum allowable roll-off factor α is **0.55**.

- The low-pass filtered (LPF) output:  
  \[

  \]
- The measured DC component is 1 V.
- \( m(t) \) is zero-mean, i.e., \( \mathbb{E}[m(t)] = 0 \).

### Step 1: Understand the DC component
The DC component of a signal is its average value over time.

So, the DC component of \( S_{\text{LPF}}(t) \) is:
\[
\text{DC} = \mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{A}{2}(m(t) + 1) \right] = \frac{A}{2} \left( \mathbb{E}[m(t)] + 1 \right)

P_b = 10^{-3}

So we set:

\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-3}

Now, solve for \(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\):

---

### Given:
- **Carrier frequency** \( f_c = 250 \) kHz  
- **Message bandwidth** \( B = 12 \) kHz  

In DSB-SC modulation:
- The modulated signal occupies two sidebands:  
  - Lower Sideband (LSB): from \( f_c - B \) to \( f_c \)  
  - Upper Sideband (USB): from \( f_c \) to \( f_c + B \)

So, the total occupied bandwidth is \( 2B = 24 \) kHz, centered at \( f_c = 250 \) kHz.

---

### Passband of the BPF:
The BPF must pass both sidebands without distortion. Therefore, the passband is:

\[

1, & \text{if } 238 \text{ kHz} \leq |f| \leq 262 \text{ kHz} \\
0, & \text{otherwise}

> Note: This assumes a symmetric BPF around 0 Hz (i.e., real-valued time-domain signal). Since the carrier is at 250 kHz, this is typically implemented as a **real band-pass filter** centered at 250 kHz.

In practical terms, the filter should have:
- **Passband**: 238 kHz to 262 kHz
- **Stopband**: below 238 kHz and above 262 kHz
- **Gain**: 1 in the passband (assuming ideal amplitude scaling)

The third-order intermodulation products grow at 3× the rate of the fundamental signals. So, if you increase the input by 1 dB, the output fundamental increases by 1 dB, but the IM3 increases by 3 dB.

Thus, the relationship between the input power and the IM3 level is:

\[
\text{P}_{\text{IM3}} = 3 \cdot \text{P}_{\text{in}} - 2 \cdot \text{IIP3}
\]

We can rearrange this to solve for IIP3:

\[
\text{IIP3} = \frac{3 \cdot \text{P}_{\text{in}} - \text{P}_{\text{IM3}}}{2}
\]

Now plug in the values:

- P_in = -6 dBm  
- P_IM3 = -10 dBm

\[
\text{IIP3} = \frac{3 \cdot (-6) - (-10)}{2} = \frac{-18 + 10}{2} = \frac{-8}{2} = -4 \, \text{dBm}
\]

Wait — that gives **-4 dBm**, which is physically unrealistic for an IIP3 (typically it's much higher than the input signal).

That suggests our interpretation may be off — because IM3 at -10 dBm when input is -6 dBm implies very poor linearity, but let’s double-check using a more intuitive method.

---

### Alternative approach: Using the Δ (30 dB) and input level

A common rule-of-thumb for estimating IIP3 from a 2-tone test is:

\[
\text{IIP3} \approx \text{P}_{\text{in}} + \frac{\Delta}{2}
\]

Where:
- P_in = input power per tone = -6 dBm
- Δ = difference between fundamental and IM3 at output = 30 dB

So:

\[
\text{IIP3} \approx -6 + \frac{30}{2} = -6 + 15 = 9 \, \text{dBm}
\]

✅ This is a widely used approximation in RF design for estimating IIP3 from a 2-tone test where Δ is measured at a given input power.

### Final Answer:
**IIP3 ≈ 9 dBm**

This means the amplifier or system has an input third-order intercept point of approximately **9 dBm**, indicating reasonable linearity for many applications.",9.0,1.0,0.01766815
Convert noise -174 dBm/Hz to W/Hz.,"To convert from dBm/Hz to watts per hertz (W/Hz), we use the relationship between power in dBm and linear power in watts.

### Step 1: Understand the reference
- **0 dBm = 1 milliwatt (mW) = 0.001 W**
- The formula to convert dBm to watts is:

\[
P_{\text{W}} = 10^{\frac{\text{dBm} - 30}{10}}
\]

This accounts for the fact that dBm is referenced to 1 mW, and we need to scale to watts.

---

### Step 2: Apply the formula
Given:
- Noise = –174 dBm/Hz

\[
P_{\text{W/Hz}} = 10^{\frac{-174 - 30}{10}} = 10^{\frac{-204}{10}} = 10^{-20.4}
\]

Now compute:

\[
10^{-20.4} = 10^{-20} \times 10^{-0.4} = 1 \times 10^{-20} \times 0.3981 \approx 3.981 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

"Doppler shift. f_c=1.8 GHz, v=20 m/s, θ=30°. Find f_D=v cosθ/λ.","To calculate the Doppler shift frequency \( f_D \), we use the formula:

\[
f_D = \frac{v \cos\theta}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( v = 20 \, \text{m/s} \) (relative velocity),
- \( \theta = 30^\circ \) (angle between velocity vector and line of sight),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the carrier signal.

First, compute the wavelength \( \lambda \) using the speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and carrier frequency \( f_c = 1.8 \, \text{GHz} = 1.8 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{1.8 \times 10^9} = \frac{1}{6} \, \text{m} = 0.1667 \, \text{m}
\]

Now plug into the Doppler formula:

\[
f_D = \frac{20 \cdot \cos(30^\circ)}{0.1667}
\]

We know \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660 \), so:

\[
f_D = \frac{20 \cdot 0.8660}{0.1667} = \frac{17.32}{0.1667} \approx 103.9 \, \text{Hz}

- Amplitude range: from -1 V to +1 V  
- Step size (Δ) = 1/64 V  
- Sampling rate = 16 kHz  

We are asked to find:
1. Bits per sample (L)
2. Bit rate

---

### Step 1: Find the number of quantization levels (L)

The formula for the number of levels is:

\[
L = \frac{\text{Range}}{\Delta}
\]

The total range is from -1 V to +1 V ⇒ Range = 1 - (-1) = **2 V**

Given Δ = 1/64 V

So,

\[
L = \frac{2}{1/64} = 2 \times 64 = 128
\]

Thus, **L = 128 levels**

---

### Step 2: Find bits per sample

Each quantization level must be represented by a unique binary code.

If there are L levels, the number of bits required per sample is:

\[
\text{bits/sample} = \log_2(L) = \log_2(128)
\]

Since 128 = 2⁷:

\[
\log_2(128) = 7
\]

✅ So, **7 bits per sample**

Laplacian noise detector: noiseless outputs 0 or A with equal priors and noise pdf f(n)=(1/(2λ))exp(-|n|/λ). Find optimal threshold V_d.,"We are given a Laplacian noise model and asked to find the optimal detection threshold \( V_d \) for distinguishing between two hypotheses:

- \( H_0 \): Noiseless output is 0 (with prior \( P(H_0) = \frac{1}{2} \))
- \( H_1 \): Noiseless output is A (with prior \( P(H_1) = \frac{1}{2} \))

The observed signal is:
\[
y = x + n
\]
where:
- \( x \in \{0, A\} \)
- \( n \sim \text{Laplacian}(0, \lambda) \), with PDF:
\[
f(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|n|/\lambda}
\]

---

### Step 1: Likelihood Functions

Let’s write the likelihoods of the observation \( y \) under each hypothesis.

Under \( H_0 \), \( y = 0 + n \), so:
\[
f(y | H_0) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y|/\lambda}
\]

Under \( H_1 \), \( y = A + n \), so:
\[
f(y | H_1) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda}
\]

---

### Step 2: Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)

The optimal detector uses the likelihood ratio:
\[
\Lambda(y) = \frac{f(y | H_1)}{f(y | H_0)} = \frac{e^{-|y - A|/\lambda}}{e^{-|y|/\lambda}} = e^{-(|y - A| - |y|)/\lambda}
\]

We decide in favor of \( H_1 \) if:
\[
\Lambda(y) > \eta
\]
where \( \eta \) is chosen based on the priors. Since both hypotheses have equal prior probability (\( P(H_0) = P(H_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)), the threshold \( \eta = 1 \).

Thus, the test becomes:
\[
\Lambda(y) > 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad |y - A| - |y| < 0
\]
i.e.,
\[
|y - A| < |y|
\]

This inequality defines the decision region for \( H_1 \).

---

### Step 3: Solve the Inequality \( |y - A| < |y| \)

We analyze this inequality by considering different regions of \( y \). Assume \( A > 0 \) (since it's a constant level; if \( A < 0 \), the logic mirrors).

#### Case 1: \( y \geq A \)
Then:
- \( |y - A| = y - A \)
- \( |y| = y \)
Inequality: \( y - A < y \) → always true ⇒ So all \( y \geq A \) are in \( H_1 \) region.

#### Case 2: \( 0 \leq y < A \)
- \( |y - A| = A - y \)
- \( |y| = y \)
Inequality: \( A - y < y \) ⇒ \( A < 2y \) ⇒ \( y > A/2 \)

So within [0, A), decision is \( H_1 \) only when \( y > A/2 \)

#### Case 3: \( y < 0 \)
- \( |y - A| = A - y \) (since \( y < 0 < A \))
- \( |y| = -y \)
Inequality: \( A - y < -y \) ⇒ \( A < 0 \) — contradiction since we assumed \( A > 0 \)

So no solutions in \( y < 0 \)

---

### Final Decision Rule

The optimal decision rule is:
- Decide \( H_1 \) (i.e., \( x = A \)) if \( y > A/2 \)
- Decide \( H_0 \) (i.e., \( x = 0 \)) if \( y \leq A/2 \)

Therefore, the **optimal threshold** is:
\[
\boxed{V_d = \frac{A}{2}}

A DSB-SC signal is centered at f_c=1 MHz and message bandwidth is 12 kHz. Specify positive-frequency passband.,"To specify the **positive-frequency passband** of a DSB-SC (Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier) signal:

### Given:
- Carrier frequency: \( f_c = 1 \, \text{MHz} \)
- Message bandwidth: \( B = 12 \, \text{kHz} \)

### DSB-SC Signal Characteristics:
In DSB-SC modulation:
- The signal occupies two sidebands:
  - **Upper Sideband (USB):** from \( f_c \) to \( f_c + B \)
  - **Lower Sideband (LSB):** from \( f_c - B \) to \( f_c \)

Since we're asked for the **positive-frequency passband**, we only consider frequencies above 0 Hz.

### Positive-Frequency Passband:
This includes:
- The **entire USB**: from \( f_c \) to \( f_c + B \)
- Any part of the LSB that lies in positive frequencies.

But since \( f_c = 1 \, \text{MHz} \gg B = 12 \, \text{kHz} \), the LSB extends from:
\[
f_c - B = 1\, \text{MHz} - 12\, \text{kHz} = 988 \, \text{kHz}
\]
to \( f_c = 1 \, \text{MHz} \), which is still entirely in the positive-frequency range.

So, the full positive-frequency passband is:

- Roll-off factor: \( \alpha = 0.25 \)  
- Formula:  
  \[
  R_b = \frac{2B \log_2(M)}{1 + \alpha}
  \]

We need to find the **minimum power-of-2** value of \( M \) that satisfies this equation.

---

### Step 1: Plug in known values
\[
240 \times 10^3 = \frac{2 \times 120 \times 10^3 \times \log_2(M)}{1 + 0.25}
\]

Simplify denominator:
\[
1 + 0.25 = 1.25
\]

So:
\[
240 \times 10^3 = \frac{240 \times 10^3 \times \log_2(M)}{1.25}
\]

Now divide both sides by \( 240 \times 10^3 \):
\[
1 = \frac{\log_2(M)}{1.25}
\]

Multiply both sides by 1.25:
\[
\log_2(M) = 1.25
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( M \)
\[
M = 2^{1.25} = 2^{5/4} = \sqrt[4]{2^5} = \sqrt[4]{32}
\]

Compute numerically:
\[
2^{1.25} \approx 2.378
\]

So \( M \approx 2.378 \)

---

### Step 3: Find minimum power-of-2 ≥ 2.378

Powers of 2:
- \( 2^1 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)

A bandpass channel has bandwidth 3000 Hz and uses binary NRZ for 2PSK. Compute spectral efficiency η.,"To compute the spectral efficiency η for a bandpass channel using binary NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) modulation with 2PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), we follow these steps:

---

### Given:
- Bandwidth of the channel \( B = 3000 \) Hz  
- Modulation: Binary NRZ → this implies **2PSK** (i.e., one bit per symbol)
- 2PSK is also known as BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)

---

### Step 1: Determine Symbol Rate
Since it's binary (2PSK), each symbol carries 1 bit.  
So, the **symbol rate** \( R_s \) equals the **bit rate** \( R_b \).

For a bandpass channel using 2PSK, the minimum required bandwidth for transmission without ISI (assuming ideal Nyquist filtering) is:

\[
B = R_s = R_b
\]

This is because 2PSK has a baseband equivalent bandwidth equal to the symbol rate, and when modulated to passband, it occupies approximately the same bandwidth.

Thus:
\[
R_b = B = 3000 \text{ bits/second}
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute Spectral Efficiency
Spectral efficiency \( \eta \) is defined as:

\[
\eta = \frac{R_b}{B} \quad \text{(in bits/second/Hz)}

"AM synchronous detection gain factor. For modulation index μ=0.6, compute G_AM=μ^2/(2+μ^2) (envelope) and compare to coherent DSB-SC gain 2. Give ratio in dB.","We are asked to compute the gain factor for AM synchronous detection (envelope detection) for a modulation index μ = 0.6, and compare it to the coherent DSB-SC gain of 2. Then express the ratio in dB.

---

### Step 1: Compute G_AM
Given:
- Modulation index μ = 0.6
- Formula for AM synchronous detection gain:

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{\mu^2}{2 + \mu^2}
\]

Plug in μ = 0.6:

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{(0.6)^2}{2 + (0.6)^2} = \frac{0.36}{2 + 0.36} = \frac{0.36}{2.36}
\]

Calculate:

\[
G_{AM} \approx \frac{0.36}{2.36} \approx 0.1525
\]

So, **G_AM ≈ 0.1525**

---

### Step 2: Coherent DSB-SC Gain
Given as:
\[
G_{DSB} = 2
\]

---

### Step 3: Ratio of G_AM to G_DSB
We compute the ratio:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{G_{AM}}{G_{DSB}} = \frac{0.1525}{2} = 0.07625
\]

---

### Step 4: Convert Ratio to dB

Use the formula:

\[
\text{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(\text{Ratio}) = 10 \log_{10}(0.07625)
\]

Calculate:

\[
\log_{10}(0.07625) \approx \log_{10}(7.625 \times 10^{-2}) = \log_{10}(7.625) + \log_{10}(10^{-2}) \approx 0.882 - 2 = -1.118
\]

Then:

\[
\text{dB} = 10 \times (-1.118) = -11.18 \, \text{dB}
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:
- AM synchronous detection gain: **G_AM ≈ 0.1525**

A bandpass channel has bandwidth 3000 Hz and uses binary NRZ for 2PSK. Compute spectral efficiency η.,"To compute the spectral efficiency \( \eta \) of a bandpass channel using binary NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) modulation in 2PSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), we follow these steps:

---

### **Given:**
- Bandwidth \( B = 3000 \) Hz
- Modulation: 2PSK (also known as BPSK)
- Symbol mapping: Binary NRZ → one bit per symbol

---

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Spectral Efficiency \( \eta \)** is defined as:
   \[
   \eta = \frac{R}{B} \quad \text{(in bits/second/Hz)}
   \]
   where:
   - \( R \) = bit rate (bits per second)
   - \( B \) = bandwidth (Hz)

2. For **2PSK**, each symbol carries **1 bit**.
3. The **minimum required bandwidth** for 2PSK using binary NRZ pulses is approximately:
   \[
   B \approx R \quad \text{(for ideal Nyquist pulse shaping, like rectangular spectrum)}
   \]
   In practice, 2PSK with sinc-like pulses can be transmitted within \( B \approx R \), and this is often used to model the minimum bandwidth.

4. So, if the channel bandwidth is 3000 Hz, and it's optimally used for 2PSK, then:
   \[
   R = B = 3000 \text{ bps}

In QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), each symbol carries 2 bits. So the symbol rate \( R_s \) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{R_b}{2} = \frac{9600}{2} = 4800 \text{ symbols per second}
\]

### Step 2: Bandwidth of Raised-Cosine Filter
The bandwidth \( B \) of a raised-cosine pulse-shaped signal is given by:

\[
B = R_s (1 + \alpha)
\]

Here, \( \alpha = 1 \), so:

\[
B = 4800 \times (1 + 1) = 4800 \times 2 = 9600 \text{ Hz}
\]

### Step 3: Compare with Available Channel Bandwidth
- Required bandwidth: **9600 Hz**
- Available channel bandwidth: **3100 Hz**

Since 9600 Hz > 3100 Hz, the signal **does not fit** in the channel.

### ✅ Conclusion:
**No, the QPSK link does not fit** in the 3100 Hz channel when using a raised-cosine filter with \( \alpha = 1 \). The required bandwidth (9600 Hz) exceeds the available channel bandwidth (3100 Hz).",No,0.8,0.0105106
"Synchronization word design (m=0). Bit rate R=200 bit/s, equiprobable bits, false sync at most once per month (30 days). Find minimum sync length n using P_f=2^{-n} and expected trials RT.","To find the minimum synchronization (sync) word length \( n \), we are given:

- Bit rate \( R = 200 \) bit/s  
- Synchronization word design with \( m = 0 \): This typically means the sync word has no special structure (i.e., it's a random sequence of bits, not using any known pattern like ""0101..."" or ""1111..."") — so each bit is independent and equiprobable.  
- False synchronization (false sync) must occur at most once per month (30 days).  
- Probability of false sync: \( P_f = 2^{-n} \)  
- Expected number of trials before a false sync: \( RT \)

---

### Step 1: Determine total bits transmitted per month

- Number of seconds in a month:  
  \( 30 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 3600 \text{ s/hour} = 2,592,000 \) s  
- Total bits sent per month:  
  \( B = R \times t = 200 \times 2,592,000 = 518,400,000 \) bits

---

### Step 2: Expected number of trials (RT)

A ""trial"" here means attempting to detect a sync word — i.e., checking every possible position for a sync word of length \( n \).

If we assume that sync words are placed periodically (e.g., once per frame), and the receiver checks one position at a time, then the number of trials per month is approximately equal to the number of positions where a sync word could be.

But often in such problems, the **expected number of trials between false syncs** is approximated as:

\[
\text{Expected trials} = \frac{1}{P_f} = 2^n
\]

This interpretation assumes that the receiver samples every \( n \) bits for a sync word — and the chance of a false match at any such position is \( P_f = 2^{-n} \).

So, if we expect **at most one false sync per month**, then the expected number of trials before a false sync must be **greater than or equal to** the number of trials per month.

Let’s define:
- \( N_{\text{trials}} \approx \frac{\text{Total bits}}{n} = \frac{518,400,000}{n} \) — since each trial involves checking an \( n \)-bit window.

We want:
\[
\frac{1}{P_f} = 2^n \geq N_{\text{trials}} = \frac{518,400,000}{n}
\]

So we solve for the smallest integer \( n \) such that:
\[
2^n \geq \frac{518,400,000}{n}
\]

This inequality must be solved numerically.

Let’s try values of \( n \):

#### Try \( n = 20 \):
- \( 2^{20} = 1,048,576 \)
- RHS: \( 518,400,000 / 20 = 25,920,000 \)
- \( 1,048,576 < 25,920,000 \) → too small

#### Try \( n = 25 \):
- \( 2^{25} = 33,554,432 \)
- RHS: \( 518,400,000 / 25 = 20,736,000 \)
- \( 33,554,432 > 20,736,000 \) → satisfies condition

#### Check \( n = 24 \):
- \( 2^{24} = 16,777,216 \)
- RHS: \( 518,400,000 / 24 = 21,600,000 \)
- \( 16,777,216 < 21,600,000 \) → fails

So, \( n = 25 \) is the smallest value satisfying:
\[
2^n \geq \frac{518,400,000}{n}
\]

---

### Final Answer:

✅ **Minimum sync length \( n = 25 \)**

At this length:
- Probability of false sync: \( P_f = 2^{-25} \approx 2.98 \times 10^{-8} \)
- Expected number of trials until false sync: \( 2^{25} = 33,554,432 \)
- Number of trials per month ≈ \( 518,400,000 / 25 = 20,736,000 \)
- So expected false sync occurs after more than 1 month → meets requirement

Thus, the answer is:

"Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ=60°. If ideal (φ=0) requires E_b/N_0=8 dB for a target BER, what additional SNR penalty (dB) is needed due to phase offset, assuming decision variable scales by cosφ?","We are given:

- Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ = 60°
- Ideal case (φ = 0°) requires E_b/N₀ = 8 dB for target BER
- Decision variable scales by cos(φ) due to phase offset
- Need to find the additional SNR penalty (in dB) caused by this phase offset

---

### Step 1: Understand the effect of phase offset
In coherent BPSK, the received signal is:
\[
r(t) = \sqrt{E_b} \cdot \cos(\omega_c t + \phi) + n(t)
\]
When the receiver correlates with the ideal local oscillator at phase 0, it uses:
\[
\int r(t) \cos(\omega_c t) dt = \sqrt{E_b} \cos(\phi) + n'
\]
So the decision variable is scaled by \( \cos(\phi) \).

This means the effective signal amplitude is reduced by a factor of \( \cos(\phi) \), while noise power remains unchanged.

Hence, the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the decision stage becomes:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{eff}} = (\cos \phi)^2 \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

But we need to maintain the same BER — so if the effective SNR is lower, we must increase the input \( E_b/N_0 \) to compensate.

---

### Step 2: Compute required increase in E_b/N₀
Let’s denote:
- \( \frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{ideal}} = 8 \text{ dB} = 10^{8/10} = 6.3096 \) (linear scale)
- Required new \( \frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{new}} \) such that:
\[
\left( \cos \phi \right)^2 \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{new}} = \frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{ideal}}
\Rightarrow \frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{(\cos \phi)^2} \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{ideal}}
\]

Given φ = 60°, so:
\[
\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5 \Rightarrow (\cos \phi)^2 = 0.25
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0}^{\text{new}} = \frac{1}{0.25} \cdot 6.3096 = 4 \cdot 6.3096 = 25.2384
\]

Convert back to dB:
\[
10 \log_{10}(25.2384) \approx 14.02 \text{ dB}
\]

Original needed: 8 dB  
New needed: ≈14.02 dB  
→ **Additional SNR penalty = 14.02 − 8 = 6.02 dB**

- The bit error probability is given as:

  P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)
  \]

---

### Step 1: Convert dB to linear scale

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{8/10} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096
\]

So,
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{6.3096} \approx 2.512
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute the Q-function

We now compute:
\[
P_b = Q(2.512)
\]

Using standard Q-function values or a calculator:

- \( Q(2.5) \approx 0.00621 \)
- \( Q(2.512) \) is slightly less than that.

A more precise value using interpolation or a Q-function calculator:

\[

Alternatively, using MATLAB or Python:
```python
from scipy.stats import norm

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{3/10} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2

So:
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2}\right) = Q(1.4142)

Using the standard Q-function value:
\[

- The signal-to-noise ratio \( \frac{S}{N} = 20 \) (in linear scale).

---

### Step 1: Plug in the value
\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{2 \times 20}\right) = Q\left(\sqrt{40}\right)
\]

Calculate \( \sqrt{40} \):

\[
\sqrt{40} = \sqrt{4 \times 10} = 2\sqrt{10} \approx 2 \times 3.1623 = 6.3246
\]

So,

\[
P_b = Q(6.3246)
\]

---

### Step 2: Evaluate the Q-function

The Q-function is defined as:

\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

For large \( x \), we can use an approximation or known values. From standard Q-function tables or calculators:

- \( Q(6.0) \approx 9.87 \times 10^{-10} \)
- \( Q(6.3) \approx 1.25 \times 10^{-10} \)
- \( Q(6.3246) \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-10} \) (very roughly)

More precisely, using a calculator or software (like MATLAB or Python's `scipy.stats.norm.sf`):

```python
from scipy.special import erfc
import numpy as np

x = np.sqrt(40)
Pb = 0.5 * erfc(x / np.sqrt(2))

  \]

Our goal is to find \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Use the inverse Q-function
We have:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 5 \times 10^{-4}
\]
Let:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}}
\]
So:
\[
Q(x) = 5 \times 10^{-4}
\]

We now need to find \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 5 \times 10^{-4} \).

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:
\[
Q(3.29) \approx 5.0 \times 10^{-4}
\]
(Specifically, \( Q(3.29) \approx 0.000500 \))

Thus:
\[
x = 3.29
\]

Now recall:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 3.29
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (3.29)^2 = 10.8241
\]

Then:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{10.8241}{2} = 5.41205

### Step 3: Convert to dB

- \( R_b = 20 \, \text{kbit/s} = 20 \times 10^3 \, \text{bit/s} \)

Compute BER for coherent orthogonal BFSK at E_b/N0=12 dB.,"To compute the Bit Error Rate (BER) for **coherent orthogonal Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK)** at \( E_b/N_0 = 12 \, \text{dB} \), we use the standard analytical expression for coherent orthogonal BFSK:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{12/10} = 10^{1.2} \approx 15.8489

### Step 2: Plug into the BER formula
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{erfc}\left( \sqrt{15.8489} \right)
\]

\[
\sqrt{15.8489} \approx 3.981
\]

Now compute the complementary error function:
\[
\operatorname{erfc}(3.981) \approx 3.27 \times 10^{-7}
\]

(Since erfc(x) for x ≈ 4 is very small — e.g., erfc(4) ≈ 1.53 × 10⁻⁷, and 3.981 is slightly less, so ~3.27×10⁻⁷ is reasonable.)

### Given:
- Prior probabilities:

  - \( P_2 = 0.1 \) (probability of symbol 2)
- Signal amplitude: \( A = 0.5 \)  
- Noise power spectral density: \( N_0 = 0.2 \)

We assume:
- Symbol 1 is transmitted as \( +A \) (i.e., \( +0.5 \))
- Symbol 2 is transmitted as \( -A \) (i.e., \( -0.5 \))
- The noise is additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), with variance \( \sigma^2 = N_0/2 = 0.1 \)

---

### MAP Decision Rule:
The MAP receiver decides in favor of symbol \( s_i \) if:

\[
P(s_i | r) > P(s_j | r) \quad \text{for } i \neq j
\]

Using Bayes' theorem and likelihoods (Gaussian):

\[
\frac{P(s_1 | r)}{P(s_2 | r)} = \frac{P(s_1) p(r|s_1)}{P(s_2) p(r|s_2)} > 1
\]

This leads to the decision threshold \( \gamma \) such that:
\[
\frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} \cdot \frac{p(r|s_1)}{p(r|s_2)} > 1
\]

Since the likelihoods are Gaussian:
\[
p(r|s_i) \propto \exp\left( -\frac{(r - s_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
\]

Taking logs and simplifying, the optimal threshold \( \gamma \) satisfies:
\[
\gamma = \frac{s_1 + s_2}{2} + \frac{\sigma^2}{s_1 - s_2} \ln \left( \frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} \right)
\]

Plug in values:

- \( s_1 = A = 0.5 \)
- \( s_2 = -A = -0.5 \)
- \( \sigma^2 = N_0/2 = 0.1 \)
- \( \frac{P(s_1)}{P(s_2)} = \frac{0.9}{0.1} = 9 \)

Then:
\[
\gamma = \frac{0.5 + (-0.5)}{2} + \frac{0.1}{0.5 - (-0.5)} \ln(9)
= 0 + \frac{0.1}{1} \ln(9)
= 0.1 \cdot \ln(9)
\]

Now compute:
- \( \ln(9) = \ln(3^2) = 2 \ln(3) \approx 2 \times 1.0986 = 2.1972 \)

So:
\[
\gamma = 0.1 \times 2.1972 = 0.21972

A bandlimited signal is sampled at 10 kHz and quantized into L=64 levels. Find bits/sample and bit rate.,"To solve this, we need to find:

1. **Bits per sample**  
2. **Bit rate**

---

### Given:
- Sampling frequency \( f_s = 10 \, \text{kHz} = 10,000 \, \text{samples/second} \)
- Number of quantization levels \( L = 64 \)

---

### 1. Bits per sample:
The number of bits per sample is determined by the number of quantization levels using:

\[
\text{Bits per sample} = \log_2(L)
\]

\[
= \log_2(64) = 6
\]

✅ So, **6 bits per sample**

---

### 2. Bit rate:
Bit rate is given by:

\[
\text{Bit rate} = \text{Bits per sample} \times \text{Sampling rate}
\]

\[
= 6 \, \text{bits/sample} \times 10,000 \, \text{samples/second} = 60,000 \, \text{bits/second}
\]

✅ So, **60 kbps (kilobits per second)**

"In coherent demodulation of an SSB signal, message bandwidth is 3 kHz and one-sided noise PSD is n_0=2×10^{-6} W/Hz. If received signal power is S_i=1 mW, compute input SNR S_i/N_i.","To compute the input SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for a Single Sideband (SSB) signal in coherent demodulation, we need to determine the noise power at the input of the receiver.

### Given:
- Message bandwidth = 3 kHz  
- One-sided noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-6} \) W/Hz  
- Received signal power \( S_i = 1 \) mW = \( 1 \times 10^{-3} \) W  

---

### Step 1: Compute Input Noise Power \( N_i \)

In coherent demodulation of an SSB signal, the noise is only present within the message bandwidth. Since this is a one-sided spectrum and the noise PSD is given as one-sided, the total noise power is:

\[
N_i = n_0 \times \text{bandwidth}
\]

\[
N_i = (2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{W/Hz}) \times (3 \times 10^3 \, \text{Hz}) = 6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{W}
\]

So, \( N_i = 6 \, \text{mW} \)

---

### Step 2: Compute Input SNR \( \frac{S_i}{N_i} \)

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{in}} = \frac{S_i}{N_i} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-3}}{6 \times 10^{-3}} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667
\]

This is the **linear** SNR.

If you want it in dB:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{in (dB)}} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) \approx 10 \log_{10}(0.1667) \approx -7.78 \, \text{dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
- **Input SNR (linear)**: \( \frac{S_i}{N_i} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667 \)
- **Input SNR (dB)**: \( \approx -7.78 \, \text{dB} \)

"Compute mean received power needed for outage 0.5%. Threshold 15 dBm, σ=4 dB.","To compute the **mean received power needed for a 0.5% outage probability**, given:

- Outage probability \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.5\% = 0.005 \)
- Threshold power \( P_{\text{th}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \)

We use the **log-normal fading model**. The received power \( P_r \) is normally distributed in dB (i.e., \( \log_{10}(P_r) \) is Gaussian), so the outage occurs when:

\[
P_r < P_{\text{th}}
\]

This corresponds to a standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF):

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]

where:
- \( \mu \) = mean received power (what we want to find),
- \( \sigma = 4 \, \text{dB} \),
- \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the standard normal CDF.

Given \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.005 \), we solve for \( \mu \):

\[
\Phi\left( \frac{15 - \mu}{4} \right) = 0.005
\]

Step 1: Find the z-score corresponding to \( \Phi(z) = 0.005 \).

From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF:

\[
z = \Phi^{-1}(0.005) \approx -2.576
\]

Step 2: Solve for \( \mu \):

\[
\frac{15 - \mu}{4} = -2.576
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
15 - \mu = -10.304
\]

Solve for \( \mu \):

\[

We need to compute \( K \).

---

### Step 1: Compute the wavelength \( \lambda \)

The speed of light \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \) m/s.

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{2 \times 10^9} = 0.15 \text{ m}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug into the formula for \( K \)

\[
K = \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d_0} \right)^2
= \left( \frac{0.15}{4\pi \times 1} \right)^2
= \left( \frac{0.15}{4\pi} \right)^2
\]

First, compute the denominator:

\[
4\pi \approx 12.5664
\]

Now compute the fraction:

\[
\frac{0.15}{12.5664} \approx 0.01194
\]

Then square it:

\[
K \approx (0.01194)^2 \approx 0.0001426

---

### Final Answer:

\[
K \approx 1.426 \times 10^{-4}

- Required output SNR = 30 dB  
- Noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)  
- Message bandwidth \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)  
- Frequency deviation \( \Delta f = 15 \, \text{kHz} \)  
- Discriminator gain: \( G_{FM} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) \)  
- Receiver bandwidth: \( B_{FM} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Convert Output SNR from dB to linear scale

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = 10^{30/10} = 1000
\]

---

### Step 2: Recall FM output SNR formula

For FM with a discriminator, the output SNR is:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} = G_{FM} \cdot \frac{S_i}{n_0 B_{FM}}
\]

Where:
- \( S_i \): input signal power (what we’re solving for)
- \( n_0 \): noise power spectral density
- \( B_{FM} \): receiver bandwidth
- \( G_{FM} \): discriminator gain

So rearranging for \( S_i \):

\[
S_i = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{out}} \cdot n_0 \cdot B_{FM}}{G_{FM}}
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute modulation index \( \beta \)

\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} = \frac{15 \text{ kHz}}{5 \text{ kHz}} = 3
\]

---

### Step 4: Compute \( G_{FM} \)

\[
G_{FM} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) = 3 \cdot (3)^2 \cdot (1 + 3) = 3 \cdot 9 \cdot 4 = 108
\]

---

### Step 5: Compute \( B_{FM} \)

\[
B_{FM} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2(15 + 5) = 40 \, \text{kHz} = 4 \times 10^4 \, \text{Hz}
\]

---

### Step 6: Plug into formula for \( S_i \)

\[
S_i = \frac{1000 \cdot (1 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot (4 \times 10^4)}{108}
\]

First compute numerator:

\[
1000 \cdot 10^{-10} \cdot 4 \times 10^4 = 4 \times 10^{-3}
\]

Now divide by 108:

\[
S_i = \frac{4 \times 10^{-3}}{108} = \frac{4}{108} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{1}{27} \times 10^{-3} \approx 0.03704 \times 10^{-3} = 3.704 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W}

\[
s(t) = A_c (1 + \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t)) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

with:
- \( A_c = 10 \, \text{V} \)
- \( \mu = 0.4 \)

We are to find the **impulse magnitudes** in the frequency domain \( S(f) \) at the following frequencies:
- \( \pm f_c \)
- \( \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \)

---

### Step 1: Expand the Signal

Use the trigonometric identity:

\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A + B) + \cos(A - B)]
\]

Let’s expand:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_c \mu \cos(2\pi f_m t) \cos(2\pi f_c t)
\]

Apply the identity to the second term:

\[
= A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \left[ \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m)t) + \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m)t) \right]
\]

So the time-domain expression is:

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) + \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t)
\]

---

### Step 2: Take Fourier Transform

The Fourier transform of \( \cos(2\pi f_0 t) \) is:

\[
\mathcal{F}\{\cos(2\pi f_0 t)\} = \frac{1}{2} [\delta(f - f_0) + \delta(f + f_0)]
\]

Apply this to each term:

- For \( A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t) \):
  \[
  \frac{A_c}{2} [\delta(f - f_c) + \delta(f + f_c)]
  \]

- For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c + f_m) t) \):
  \[
  \frac{A_c \mu}{4} [\delta(f - (f_c + f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c + f_m))]
  \]

- For \( \frac{A_c \mu}{2} \cos(2\pi (f_c - f_m) t) \):
  \[
  \frac{A_c \mu}{4} [\delta(f - (f_c - f_m)) + \delta(f + (f_c - f_m))]
  \]

---

### Step 3: Combine and State Impulse Magnitudes

Now sum all components:

- At \( f = \pm f_c \):  
  Magnitude = \( \frac{A_c}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{V} \)

- At \( f = \pm (f_c \pm f_m) \):  
  Each sideband (upper and lower) has magnitude \( \frac{A_c \mu}{4} \)

  So:
  \[
  \frac{10 \times 0.4}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \, \text{V}
  \]

Note: There are **two** sidebands:
- Upper sideband: \( f = f_c + f_m \) and \( f = -f_c - f_m \)
- Lower sideband: \( f = f_c - f_m \) and \( f = -f_c + f_m \)

Each has impulse magnitude **1 V**

---

Convert to linear scale:  
\[

Then:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2 \times 15.8489} = \sqrt{31.6978} \approx 5.63
\]

---

### Step 2: Evaluate the Q-function
We need:
\[
P_b = Q(5.63)
\]

Using a standard Q-function table or calculator:
\[
Q(5.63) \approx 1.06 \times 10^{-8}

First, convert SNR from dB to linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{8}{10}} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096

Now plug into the formula:

\[
C = 10 \times 10^6 \times \log_2(1 + 6.3096) = 10^7 \times \log_2(7.3096)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(7.3096) \):

\[
\log_2(7.3096) = \frac{\log_{10}(7.3096)}{\log_{10}(2)} \approx \frac{0.8638}{0.3010} \approx 2.869

- \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10 \)

Step-by-step:

1. Compute the argument of the Q-function:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623
\]

2. Evaluate the Q-function at 3.1623:
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt

### Step 1: Calculate the number of cells needed
\[
\text{Number of cells} = \frac{\text{Total users}}{\text{Users per cell}} = \frac{100,000}{150} = 666.67

"Noise power in band. Two-sided PSD N0/2=2×10^{-12} W/Hz, bandpass filter equivalent noise bandwidth B=50 kHz (one-sided around carrier). Compute total noise power passed (assume both sidebands, total bandwidth 2B).","We are given:

- Two-sided power spectral density (PSD):  
  \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

- Bandpass filter equivalent noise bandwidth:  
  \( B = 50 \, \text{kHz} \) (this is one-sided around the carrier)

- The total bandwidth of the signal (both sidebands) is \( 2B = 100 \, \text{kHz} \)

We are to compute the **total noise power passed** through the bandpass filter.

---

### Step 1: Understand what ""equivalent noise bandwidth"" means

The equivalent noise bandwidth \( B \) (one-sided) for a bandpass filter is defined such that the total noise power passed equals:

\[
P_N = \left( \frac{N_0}{2} \right) \times 2B
\]

Why? Because:
- The two-sided PSD is \( \frac{N_0}{2} \), which means it's symmetric around zero frequency.
- The filter passes both sidebands — from \( -B \) to \( +B \) in frequency (i.e., total bandwidth \( 2B \)).
- So the total noise power is:
  \[
  P_N = \int_{-B}^{B} \frac{N_0}{2} \, df = \frac{N_0}{2} \cdot (2B)
  \]

Alternatively, since the one-sided bandwidth is \( B \), and we’re integrating over a total bandwidth of \( 2B \), the formula simplifies to:

\[
P_N = \frac{N_0}{2} \cdot 2B = N_0 B
\]

Wait! Let’s be precise here. This only works if we interpret the given \( \frac{N_0}{2} \) as the **two-sided** PSD, which is standard.

Given:
- \( \frac{N_0}{2} = 2 \times 10^{-12} \) ⇒ so \( N_0 = 4 \times 10^{-12} \)

Now, total noise power passed through the bandpass filter (with total bandwidth \( 2B \)) is:

\[
P_N = \left( \frac{N_0}{2} \right) \times (2B)
= (2 \times 10^{-12}) \times (2 \times 50 \times 10^3)
\]

Let’s compute:

- \( 2B = 2 \times 50 \, \text{kHz} = 100 \, \text{kHz} = 10^5 \, \text{Hz} \)

So:

\[
P_N = (2 \times 10^{-12}) \times (10^5) = 2 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{W}

"For Gray-coded 16-QAM, require p_b≈10^{-3} using p_b≈(3/4)Q(\sqrt{4γ_b/5}). Find E_b/N_0 in dB.","We are given:

- A Gray-coded 16-QAM system
- Target bit error rate: \( p_b \approx 10^{-3} \)
- Approximate BER formula for Gray-coded 16-QAM:
  \[
  p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right)
  \]
- Need to find \( E_b/N_0 \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Use the given equation
Set the right-hand side equal to \( 10^{-3} \):

\[
\frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = 10^{-3}
\]

Divide both sides by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{4}{3000} = \frac{1}{750} \approx 0.001333...
\]

So now we solve:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \right) = 0.001333
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \), so:
\[
Q(x) = 0.001333
\]

We need to find \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 0.001333 \).

From standard \( Q \)-function tables or using a calculator/inverse Q-function:

- \( Q(2.98) \approx 0.00144 \)
- \( Q(3.00) \approx 0.00135 \)
- \( Q(3.02) \approx 0.00126 \)

Interpolating between 3.00 and 3.02:

At \( x = 3.00 \), \( Q = 0.00135 \)  
At \( x = 3.02 \), \( Q = 0.00126 \)  
We want \( Q = 0.001333 \)

Difference:  
\( \Delta Q = 0.00135 - 0.001333 = 0.000017 \)  
Total range over 0.02 in \( x \): \( \Delta Q = 0.00009 \)

So:
\[
x \approx 3.00 + \frac{0.000017}{0.00009} \times 0.02 \approx 3.00 + 0.00378 \approx 3.0038
\]

More accurately, use inverse Q-function (or standard approximation):

Using a more precise tool or MATLAB/Python:

```python
from scipy.special import erfc
import numpy as np

# Solve Q(x) = 0.001333
# Q(x) = 0.5 * erfc(x / sqrt(2))
# So: erfc(x / sqrt(2)) = 2 * 0.001333 = 0.002666
# Then: x / sqrt(2) = erfcinv(0.002666)
```

Or use known result:  
From tables or tools, \( x \approx 3.00 \) is close enough for practical purposes — let’s use \( x \approx 3.00 \) as a good estimate.

So:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{4\gamma_b}{5}} \approx 3.00
\]

Now square both sides:
\[
\frac{4\gamma_b}{5} = 9
\]

Solve for \( \gamma_b \):
\[
4\gamma_b = 45 \Rightarrow \gamma_b = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25
\]

Since \( \gamma_b = E_b/N_0 \), we have:
\[
E_b/N_0 = 11.25
\]

Convert to dB:
\[
E_b/N_0 \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(11.25) \approx 10 \times 1.0512 \approx 10.51 \, \text{dB}

- \( R_b = 50 \times 10^3 \, \text{bit/s} \) (bit rate).

### Step 1: Convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale

E_b/N_0 = 10^{10/10} = 10^1 = 10

### Step 2: Plug into the formula

"Compute group sync length n for false sync ≤ once per day. Bit rate R=50 bit/s, equiprobable bits, no errors allowed (m=0). Use P_f=2^{-n} ≤ 1/(RT).","We are asked to compute the group sync length \( n \) such that the probability of a false sync (i.e., a false detection of synchronization) is at most once per day, given:

- Bit rate \( R = 50 \) bits/second  
- Equiprobable bits (so each bit is equally likely to be 0 or 1)  
- No errors allowed (\( m = 0 \))  
- Probability of false sync: \( P_f \leq \frac{1}{RT} \), where \( T \) is the time period (1 day)

---

### Step 1: Understand the false sync probability
For a group sync pattern of length \( n \), with equiprobable bits and no errors, the probability that a random sequence of \( n \) bits matches the sync pattern is:
\[
P_f = 2^{-n}
\]

This is because there are \( 2^n \) possible sequences, and only one is the correct sync pattern.

We want this probability to be ≤ once per day. So we set:
\[
P_f \leq \frac{1}{RT}
\]
where \( T \) is the time between potential sync attempts — in this case, one day.

---

### Step 2: Compute \( RT \)
Convert 1 day into seconds:
\[
T = 1 \text{ day} = 24 \times 60 \times 60 = 86400 \text{ seconds}
\]

Given \( R = 50 \) bits/second:
\[
RT = 50 \times 86400 = 4,320,000
\]

So:
\[
P_f \leq \frac{1}{4,320,000}
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( n \)

We require:
\[
2^{-n} \leq \frac{1}{4,\!320,\!000}
\]

Take logs (base 2):
\[
-n \leq \log_2\left(\frac{1}{4,\!320,\!000}\right) = -\log_2(4,\!320,\!000)
\]

So:
\[
n \geq \log_2(4,\!320,\!000)
\]

Compute \( \log_2(4,\!320,\!000) \):

Use change of base:
\[
\log_2(4,\!320,\!000) = \frac{\ln(4,\!320,\!000)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{15.278}{0.6931} \approx 21.97
\]

So:
\[
n \geq 21.97 \Rightarrow n = 22

- The **desired tone output** changes 1 dB per 1 dB input.
- The **third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3)** changes 3 dB per 1 dB input.
- At input = −6 dBm:
  - Desired output = 20 dBm
  - IM3 = −10 dBm

We are to find the input level (in dBm) where **IM3 equals the desired output**, i.e., when:

\[
\text{IM3 (dBm)} = \text{Desired Output (dBm)}
\]

---

### Step 1: Understand how both change with input

Let’s define:
- \( P_{\text{in}} \): input power in dBm
- \( P_{\text{out}}(P_{\text{in}}) \): desired output power
- \( I(P_{\text{in}}) \): IM3 power

From the problem:
- Desired output increases at 1 dB per 1 dB increase in input ⇒ linear slope of 1
- IM3 increases at 3 dB per 1 dB increase in input ⇒ linear slope of 3

So we can write:

\[
P_{\text{out}}(P_{\text{in}}) = a + (P_{\text{in}} - (-6)) \cdot 1
\]
\[
I(P_{\text{in}}) = b + (P_{\text{in}} - (-6)) \cdot 3
\]

At \( P_{\text{in}} = -6 \):
- \( P_{\text{out}} = 20 \)
- \( I = -10 \)

Plug into equations:

For desired output:
\[
20 = a + ( -6 - (-6) ) \Rightarrow a = 20
\]
So:
\[
P_{\text{out}}(P_{\text{in}}) = 20 + (P_{\text{in}} + 6)
= P_{\text{in}} + 26
\]

For IM3:
\[
-10 = b + 0 \Rightarrow b = -10
\]
So:
\[
I(P_{\text{in}}) = -10 + 3(P_{\text{in}} + 6)
= -10 + 3P_{\text{in}} + 18
= 3P_{\text{in}} + 8
\]

---

### Step 2: Set IM3 = Desired Output

Set \( I(P_{\text{in}}) = P_{\text{out}}(P_{\text{in}}) \):

\[
3P_{\text{in}} + 8 = P_{\text{in}} + 26
\]

Subtract \( P_{\text{in}} \) from both sides:

\[
2P_{\text{in}} + 8 = 26
\]

Subtract 8:

\[
2P_{\text{in}} = 18

Divide by 2:

\[
P_{\text{in}} = 9 \, \text{dBm}

### Given:
- Shadowing standard deviation: σ = 10 dB  
- Outage threshold: \( P_{\text{th}} = 5 \) dBm  
- Mean received power: \( \mu = 15 \) dBm  

The received power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
or in dB terms, the **log-power** \( X = 10 \log_{10}(P_r) \) is normally distributed:
\[
X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

### Outage occurs when:
\[
P_r < P_{\text{th}} \Rightarrow X < 5
\]

So the outage probability is:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(X < 5) = \Phi\left( \frac{5 - \mu}{\sigma} \right)

"A (7,4) code can correct 1 error. What is its minimum distance d_min?","For a block code, the relationship between the number of correctable errors and the minimum distance is given by:

\[
t \leq \left\lfloor \frac{d_{\text{min}} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor
\]

Where:
- \( t \) = number of correctable errors
- \( d_{\text{min}} \) = minimum Hamming distance

Given that the (7,4) code can correct **1 error**, we have \( t = 1 \).

Plug into the formula:

\[
1 \leq \left\lfloor \frac{d_{\text{min}} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor
\]

To satisfy this inequality, the smallest integer \( d_{\text{min}} \) such that this holds is:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{d_{\text{min}} - 1}{2} \right\rfloor \geq 1
\Rightarrow \frac{d_{\text{min}} - 1}{2} \geq 1
\Rightarrow d_{\text{min}} - 1 \geq 2
\Rightarrow d_{\text{min}} \geq 3
\]

So the **minimum distance** must be at least 3.

A channel has capacity per Hz C/B=2 bit/s/Hz. Find SNR in dB.,"We are given the channel capacity per hertz:

\[
\frac{C}{B} = 2 \ \text{bit/s/Hz}

"M-ary requirement. Bandwidth fixed, roll-off α=0.25. Compared to binary (M=2), information rate must triple. What M is needed assuming η∝log2 M?","We are given:

- Bandwidth \( B \) is fixed.
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.25 \).
- The information rate must **triple** compared to binary (M=2).
- Efficiency \( \eta \propto \log_2 M \), which implies the spectral efficiency (bits/s/Hz) is proportional to \( \log_2 M \).

---

### Step 1: Spectral Efficiency Formula

For a Nyquist channel with roll-off \( \alpha \), the maximum symbol rate (baud rate) is:

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

The information rate \( R \) is:

\[
R = R_s \cdot \log_2 M = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha} \cdot \log_2 M
\]

This is the spectral efficiency in bits/sec/Hz:
\[
\eta = \frac{R}{B} = \frac{2}{1 + \alpha} \log_2 M
\]

So yes, \( \eta \propto \log_2 M \), as stated.

---

### Step 2: Binary Case (M=2)

\[
\eta_2 = \frac{2}{1 + 0.25} \log_2 2 = \frac{2}{1.25} \cdot 1 = 1.6 \text{ bits/s/Hz}
\]

Let’s call this \( R_2 = \eta_2 \cdot B = 1.6B \)

We need the new information rate \( R \) to be triple that of binary:

\[
R = 3 \times R_2 = 3 \times 1.6B = 4.8B
\]

But \( R = \eta \cdot B \), so:

\[
\eta = \frac{R}{B} = 4.8 \text{ bits/s/Hz}
\]

Now solve for \( M \) such that:

\[
\eta = \frac{2}{1 + \alpha} \log_2 M = \frac{2}{1.25} \log_2 M = 1.6 \log_2 M
\]

Set equal to 4.8:

\[
1.6 \log_2 M = 4.8
\]

\[
\log_2 M = \frac{4.8}{1.6} = 3
\]

\[
M = 2^3 = 8

- SNR values (γ):  
  γ = {10, 3.162, 1, 0.1}  
- Corresponding probabilities:  
  P(γ) = {0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25} → uniform distribution  
- γ_min = 1  
- Outage capacity formula:  
  \[
  \frac{C}{B} = (1 - p_{\text{out}}) \log_2(1 + \gamma_{\min})
  \]

### Step 1: Compute outage probability \( p_{\text{out}} \)

Outage occurs when the SNR falls below \( \gamma_{\min} = 1 \).

From the given γ values:
- γ = 10 → ≥1 → **not outage**
- γ = 3.162 → ≥1 → **not outage**
- γ = 1 → =1 → **not outage** (since γ_min is inclusive)
- γ = 0.1 → <1 → **outage**

So, only one out of four cases causes outage.

Thus:
\[
p_{\text{out}} = P(\gamma < \gamma_{\min}) = P(\gamma = 0.1) = 0.25
\]

### Step 2: Plug into the outage capacity formula

\[
\frac{C}{B} = (1 - 0.25) \log_2(1 + 1) = 0.75 \cdot \log_2(2) = 0.75 \cdot 1 = 0.75

Find step size Δ (V).,"To find the uniform quantization step size Δ for a signal range from −3 V to +3 V using L = 256 levels (including both endpoints), follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Determine the total range
The total signal range is:
\[
\text{Range} = 3\, \text{V} - (-3\, \text{V}) = 6\, \text{V}

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for uniform quantizer step size
For a uniform quantizer with L levels, the step size Δ is given by:
\[
\Delta = \frac{\text{Range}}{L - 1}
\]
We divide by \(L - 1\) because the number of intervals (steps) between L levels is \(L - 1\).

- A (7,4) linear code.
- Received codeword: r = 1101101
- Syndrome: s = [0 0 1]
- The syndrome corresponds to **column 7** of the parity-check matrix H.

### Goal:
Determine which bit position is in error.

---

### Key Idea:
In linear block codes, the syndrome s = H × r^T is calculated. If there's a single error in position i, then the syndrome equals the i-th column of H.

So, if the syndrome matches **column j** of H, then the error is in position **j**.

Here, it's explicitly stated that:

> ""The syndrome corresponds to column 7 in H""

That means:
- s = H₇ (the 7th column of H)

Therefore, the error occurred in **bit position 7**.

Note: Bit positions are typically numbered from 1 to 7 (leftmost bit is position 1).

So, the received word is:

| Position | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| r        | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |

The error is in position 7 → so the **7th bit** is flipped.

Original r = 1101101  
Corrected codeword = 1101100

"For OFDM Rayleigh model Pr(r>A0)=exp(-A0^2), find A0 for clipping probability 5%.","We are given the probability that the received signal amplitude \( r \) exceeds a threshold \( A_0 \) in an OFDM Rayleigh fading channel:

\[
P(r > A_0) = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

We are asked to find \( A_0 \) such that this probability is 5%, i.e.,

\[
P(r > A_0) = 0.05
\]

### Step 1: Set up the equation
\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.05
\]

### Step 2: Take the natural logarithm of both sides
\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.05)
\]

\[
A_0^2 = -\ln(0.05)
\]

### Step 3: Compute the value
\[
\ln(0.05) \approx \ln\left(\frac{1}{20}\right) = -\ln(20) \approx -2.9957
\]

So,

\[
A_0^2 = 2.9957

"A squaring-loop SSB carrier recovery: LPF output after squaring is 0.5[m^2(t)+mhat^2(t)]. If m(t)=cosω_mt, what is time-average of LPF output?","We are given:

- A squaring-loop SSB (single sideband) carrier recovery system.
- The LPF (low-pass filter) output after squaring is:
  
  \[
  y(t) = 0.5 \left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]
  \]

- Input message: \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \)
- We are to find the **time-average** of this LPF output.

---

### Step 1: Understand the components

The expression includes:
- \( m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t) \)
- \( \hat{m}(t) \): This is the Hilbert transform of \( m(t) \), often denoted as \( \hat{m}(t) = \sin(\omega_m t) \) for a cosine input.

So, we can write:

\[
m(t) = \cos(\omega_m t), \quad \hat{m}(t) = \sin(\omega_m t)
\]

Now plug into the expression:

\[
y(t) = 0.5 \left[ \cos^2(\omega_m t) + \sin^2(\omega_m t) \right]
\]

But from trig identity:
\[
\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1
\]

So,
\[
y(t) = 0.5 \cdot 1 = 0.5
\]

This is a **constant** function — it does not vary with time!

---

### Step 2: Time-average of y(t)

Since \( y(t) = 0.5 \) for all \( t \), its time-average is simply:

\[
\langle y(t) \rangle = 0.5
\]

"Coherent BPSK with phase offset φ=60°. If ideal (φ=0) requires E_b/N_0=8 dB for a target BER, what additional SNR penalty (dB) is needed due to phase offset, assuming decision variable scales by cosφ?","We are given:

- Coherent BPSK with a phase offset φ = 60°
- Ideal (φ = 0) requires E_b/N₀ = 8 dB for a target BER
- Decision variable scales by cos(φ) due to the phase offset

We are to find the **additional SNR penalty (in dB)** caused by this phase offset.

---

### Step 1: Understand the effect of phase offset
In coherent BPSK, the received signal is:
\[
r(t) = \sqrt{E_b} \cdot s(t) \cdot e^{j\phi} + n(t)
\]
where \( \phi \) is the phase offset. The decision variable after matched filtering (or correlation) becomes:
\[
z = \sqrt{E_b} \cdot \cos(\phi) + n_d
\]
where \( n_d \) is the noise component, still having variance \( N_0/2 \).

So, the effective signal amplitude at the decision stage is reduced by a factor of \( \cos(\phi) \), while the noise power remains unchanged.

This means the **effective signal-to-noise ratio** at the decision point becomes:
\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{eff}} = \frac{ (\sqrt{E_b} \cos\phi)^2 }{N_0/2} = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \cdot \cos^2\phi
\]

But for the same BER, we need the same effective SNR. So, to compensate for the reduced signal amplitude, we must increase the input \( E_b/N_0 \) by a factor that makes:
\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{new}} \cdot \cos^2\phi = \left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{ideal}}
\]

Thus:
\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{new}} = \frac{ \left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{ideal}} }{ \cos^2\phi }
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug in φ = 60°
\[
\cos(60^\circ) = 0.5 \Rightarrow \cos^2(60^\circ) = 0.25
\]

So:
\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{new}} = \frac{8~\text{dB}}{0.25}
\]

First convert 8 dB to linear scale:
\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{ideal}} = 10^{8/10} = 10^{0.8} \approx 6.3096
\]

Then:
\[
\left( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \right)_{\text{new}} = \frac{6.3096}{0.25} = 25.2384
\]

Now convert back to dB:
\[
10 \log_{10}(25.2384) \approx 14.02 \text{ dB}
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute additional SNR penalty
\[
\text{Penalty} = 14.02~\text{dB} - 8~\text{dB} = 6.02~\text{dB}
\]

Alternatively, since the reduction is by a factor of \( \cos^2\phi \), and \( \cos^2(60^\circ) = 0.25 \), the required SNR increase is:
\[
10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{\cos^2\phi} \right) = 10 \log_{10}\left( \frac{1}{0.25} \right) = 10 \log_{10}(4) = 6.02 \text{ dB}
\]

Find transmit power S_t=S_i/α.","We are asked to compute the required transmit power \( S_t \) for a Single Sideband Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC) system, given:

- Desired output SNR: \( \text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} \)
- Output noise power: \( N_o = 1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{W} \)
- Coherent SSB-SC: \( \frac{S_o}{N_o} = \frac{S_i}{N_i} \)
- Input noise power: \( N_i = 4N_o \)
- Channel attenuation: \( \alpha = 10^{-8} \)
- Transmit power: \( S_t = \frac{S_i}{\alpha} \)

### Step 1: Convert output SNR from dB to linear scale
\[
\text{SNR}_o = 30 \, \text{dB} \Rightarrow \frac{S_o}{N_o} = 10^{30/10} = 10^3 = 1000
\]

Since it's coherent SSB-SC:
\[

- Number of levels: \( M = 64 \)
- Formula for SQNR in decibels:  
  \[
  \text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(M)

### Step-by-step Calculation:

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(64)
\]

First, compute \( \log_{10}(64) \):

- Note that \( 64 = 2^6 \), so:
  \[
  \log_{10}(64) = \log_{10}(2^6) = 6 \log_{10}(2)
  \]
- Approximate \( \log_{10}(2) \approx 0.3010 \), so:
  \[
  \log_{10}(64) \approx 6 \times 0.3010 = 1.806

Matched filter for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Find h(t)=s(T-t).,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

This is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \). It's a causal pulse of duration \( \frac{T}{3} \).

---

### Goal:
Find the matched filter impulse response \( h(t) = s(T - t) \)

---

### Step-by-step:

1. **Understand \( s(T - t) \):**
   This is a time-reversal and shift operation on \( s(t) \).  
   Specifically, \( h(t) = s(T - t) \) means:
   - Replace every \( t \) in \( s(t) \) with \( (T - t) \)
   - So we're flipping \( s(t) \) around \( t = T/2 \), but more directly: it's a time reversal about the origin followed by a shift to the right by \( T \)

2. **First, write \( s(\tau) \):**
   Let \( \tau = T - t \), then:
   \[
   h(t) = s(T - t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( T - t - \frac{T}{3} \right) \right]
   \]

   Simplify the second term:
   \[
   T - t - \frac{T}{3} = \frac{2T}{3} - t
   \]

   So:
   \[
   h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right]
   \]

3. **Interpret this expression:**
   The unit step functions define intervals where the function is nonzero.

   - \( U(T - t) = 1 \) when \( t \leq T \)
   - \( U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) = 1 \) when \( t \leq \frac{2T}{3} \)

   So:
   - For \( t < \frac{2T}{3} \): both steps are 1 → difference = 0
   - For \( \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \): first step = 1, second = 0 → difference = 1
   - For \( t > T \): both are 0 → difference = 0

   Therefore, \( h(t) \) is nonzero **only** for \( \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \), and equals \( A \) there.

4. **Final Expression:**

\[
h(t) = 
\begin{cases}
A, & \frac{2T}{3} \leq t \leq T \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Or using unit step functions:

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(t - \tfrac{2T}{3}) - U(t - T) \right]
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{h(t) = A \left[ U\left(t - \frac{2T}{3}\right) - U(t - T) \right]}

### Given:
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.001 \)
- Threshold power: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)
- We want to find the mean power \( \mu \) (in dBm)

### Step-by-step:

In a log-normal channel, the received power \( P_r \) is normally distributed in dB:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

The outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \), so:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = \Phi\left( \frac{P_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)

where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution.

Set this equal to 0.001:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{10 - \mu}{6} \right) = 0.001

Now solve for the argument of Φ:
- From standard normal tables or using inverse CDF (probit function):

A uniform PCM system uses n=10 bits/sample over amplitude range 5 V. Find quantization step Δ.,"In a Uniform Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) system, the quantization step size Δ is determined by the total amplitude range and the number of bits used for quantization.

Given:
- Number of bits per sample, n = 10
- Amplitude range = 5 V (from -2.5 V to +2.5 V, assuming symmetric about zero)

### Step 1: Total number of quantization levels
For n bits, the number of quantization levels is:

\[
L = 2^n = 2^{10} = 1024
\]

### Step 2: Quantization step size Δ
The full amplitude range is 5 V, which spans from the minimum value to the maximum value. So, the total range is:

\[
\text{Range} = 5 \, \text{V}
\]

This range is divided into \( L = 1024 \) equal intervals (quantization levels). Therefore, the quantization step size is:

\[
\Delta = \frac{\text{Total Range}}{L} = \frac{5}{1024} \approx 0.0048828125 \, \text{V}
\]

Or in millivolts:

\[
\Delta \approx 4.883 \, \text{mV}

Laplacian noise detector: noiseless outputs 0 or A with equal priors and noise pdf f(n)=(1/(2λ))exp(-|n|/λ). Find optimal threshold V_d.,"We are given a Laplacian noise detection problem:

- The signal (or ""noiseless output"") is binary:  
  \( x = 0 \) or \( x = A \), each with equal prior probability:  
  \( P(x=0) = P(x=A) = \frac{1}{2} \)

- The noise \( n \) is Laplacian distributed:  
  \( f(n) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|n|/\lambda} \)

- The observed signal is:  
  \( y = x + n \)

We want to find the **optimal threshold \( V_d \)** for deciding between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = A \), using **maximum a posteriori (MAP)** decision rule.

---

### Step 1: Likelihoods
Since \( y = x + n \), the conditional PDF of \( y \) given \( x \) is:

- If \( x = 0 \):  
  \( f(y | x=0) = f(n = y) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y|/\lambda} \)

- If \( x = A \):  
  \( f(y | x=A) = f(n = y - A) = \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda} \)

---

### Step 2: MAP Decision Rule
The MAP rule decides \( x = A \) if:
\[
f(y | x=A) P(x=A) > f(y | x=0) P(x=0)
\]
Since priors are equal (\( P(x=0) = P(x=A) = \frac{1}{2} \)), this simplifies to:
\[
f(y | x=A) > f(y | x=0)
\]

So we compare:
\[
\frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y - A|/\lambda} > \frac{1}{2\lambda} e^{-|y|/\lambda}
\]

Canceling the common factor \( \frac{1}{2\lambda} \):
\[
e^{-|y - A|/\lambda} > e^{-|y|/\lambda}
\]

Take logarithms (monotonic):
\[
- \frac{|y - A|}{\lambda} > - \frac{|y|}{\lambda}
\Rightarrow |y| < |y - A|
\]

So we decide \( x = A \) when \( |y| < |y - A| \).

This inequality defines the optimal decision boundary.

---

### Step 3: Solve \( |y| < |y - A| \)

We analyze where this inequality holds. It's easier to square both sides (since both sides are non-negative):

\[
|y|^2 < |y - A|^2
\Rightarrow y^2 < (y - A)^2
\Rightarrow y^2 < y^2 - 2Ay + A^2
\Rightarrow 0 < -2Ay + A^2
\Rightarrow 2Ay < A^2
\Rightarrow y < \frac{A}{2}
\quad \text{(assuming } A > 0 \text{)}
\]

Therefore, the decision rule is:
- Decide \( x = A \) if \( y < \frac{A}{2} \)
- Decide \( x = 0 \) if \( y \geq \frac{A}{2} \)

So the **optimal threshold** is:
\[
V_d = \frac{A}{2}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{V_d = \frac{A}{2}}
\]

This threshold minimizes the probability of error under the MAP criterion for equal priors and Laplacian noise.",2.0,1.0,0.07694150000000001

QPSK RC system has B=20 kHz and α=0.5. Find max bit rate.,"To find the maximum bit rate for a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) system with a Root Raised Cosine (RC) pulse shaping filter, we use the relationship between the symbol rate, bandwidth, and roll-off factor.

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 20 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.5 \)

### Step 1: Symbol Rate (\( R_s \))
For a root-raised cosine filter, the relationship between bandwidth and symbol rate is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}

What maximum bit rate fits (ignore guard bands)?","To find the maximum bit rate for a QPSK signal in a given RF bandwidth with a Root Raised Cosine (RRC) filter, we use the relationship between symbol rate, bandwidth, and modulation.

---

### Given:
- **Bandwidth of the channel (RF bandwidth)** = 3100 Hz  
- **Modulation**: QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying)  
- **RRC roll-off factor** α = 0.35  
- **No guard bands** — so all 3100 Hz is used efficiently

---

### Step 1: Symbol Rate (Rs) from Bandwidth
For RRC filtering, the required bandwidth is:

\[
B = R_s \cdot (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( B \) = available bandwidth = 3100 Hz  
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor = 0.35  
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (symbols per second)

Solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha} = \frac{3100}{1 + 0.35} = \frac{3100}{1.35} \approx 2296.3 \, \text{symbols/second}
\]

---

### Step 2: Bit Rate (Rb)
QPSK encodes 2 bits per symbol:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 2296.3 \approx 4592.6 \, \text{bits per second}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

\]

and we want to find \( A_0 \) such that this probability equals 0.05:

\[
\exp(-A_0^2) = 0.05

### Step 1: Take the natural logarithm of both sides
\[
\ln\left(\exp(-A_0^2)\right) = \ln(0.05)
\]
\[
-A_0^2 = \ln(0.05)

### Step 2: Solve for \( A_0^2 \)
\[

Calculate \( \ln(0.05) \):

\[
\ln(0.05) \approx \ln\left(\frac{1}{20}\right) = -\ln(20) \approx -2.9957

"Water-filling normalized power allocation. Cutoff γ_0=0.8. For state γ=0.5, compute S(γ)/S.","To compute \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) for a water-filling normalized power allocation with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \) and state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), we follow the principles of water-filling in multi-channel systems.

---

### **Key Concepts:**
- In water-filling, power is allocated to channels based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) \( \gamma_i \).
- A **cutoff threshold** \( \gamma_0 \) determines which channels get any power:
  - Channels with \( \gamma_i \geq \gamma_0 \) are ""filled"" with power.
  - Channels with \( \gamma_i < \gamma_0 \) receive zero power.
- The total power is normalized such that the average power is 1 (i.e., \( S = 1 \)).

In this case:
- \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \)
- Given state \( \gamma = 0.5 \)

Since \( \gamma = 0.5 < \gamma_0 = 0.8 \), this channel does **not** receive any power under optimal water-filling.

---

### **Result:**
- Power allocated to this channel: \( S(\gamma) = 0 \)
- Total normalized power: \( S = 1 \)

Noncoherent orthogonal BFSK. Target BER 10^{-2}. Find required E_b/N_0 in dB using P_b=0.5 e^{-\gamma_b/2}.,"We are given:

- A **noncoherent orthogonal BFSK** system.
- Target **BER = 10⁻²** (i.e., 0.01).
- The bit error probability formula for noncoherent orthogonal BFSK is:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\gamma_b / 2}
\]

where:
- \( P_b \) is the bit error rate,
- \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) is the energy-per-bit to noise-power spectral density ratio (in linear scale).

---

### Step 1: Plug in the target BER
Set \( P_b = 10^{-2} \):

\[
10^{-2} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-\gamma_b / 2}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-2} = e^{-\gamma_b / 2}
\]
\[
0.02 = e^{-\gamma_b / 2}
\]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.02) = -\frac{\gamma_b}{2}
\]

Calculate \( \ln(0.02) \):

\[
\ln(0.02) \approx \ln(2 \times 10^{-2}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-2}) \approx 0.6931 - 4.6052 = -3.9121
\]

So:

\[
-3.9121 = -\frac{\gamma_b}{2}
\]

Multiply both sides by -2:

\[

- Formula for SQNR (Signal-to-Quantization Noise Ratio) in decibels:
  \[

  \]

### Step-by-step calculation:

\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(512)
\]

First, express 512 as a power of 2:
\[
512 = 2^9

So,
\[
\log_{10}(512) = \log_{10}(2^9) = 9 \log_{10}(2)

We know that:
\[
\log_{10}(2) \approx 0.3010

Thus:
\[
\log_{10}(512) = 9 \times 0.3010 = 2.709

Coherent BPSK over AWGN. Find the minimum E_b/N_0 (in dB) required to achieve P_b = 10^{-5}.,"To find the minimum \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) (in dB) required to achieve a bit error probability \( P_b = 10^{-5} \) for **coherent BPSK over an AWGN channel**, we use the standard analytical expression for the bit error rate of coherent BPSK:

\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Where:
- \( Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt \) is the Q-function.
- \( E_b \): energy per bit
- \( N_0 \): noise power spectral density

We want:
\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right) = 10^{-5}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-5}
\]

From Q-function tables or using software (e.g., MATLAB, Python), we know that:
\[
Q(4.265) \approx 10^{-5}
\]

So:
\[
x = 4.265 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = 4.265
\]

Square both sides:
\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (4.265)^2 \approx 18.19

"Outage capacity. SNR states γ={5,2,1,0.5} with probs {0.1,0.2,0.4,0.3}. Choose γ_min=1. Compute C/B.","To compute the **outage capacity per Hz (C/B)**, we need to evaluate the average achievable rate under the given SNR states and outage threshold.

---

### Given:
- SNR states: γ = {5, 2, 1, 0.5}
- Probabilities: p = {0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3}
- Outage threshold: γ_min = 1

This means:  
A transmission is considered successful only if γ ≥ γ_min = 1.  
If γ < 1, an outage occurs — in this case, the rate is 0.

---

### Step 1: Identify active (non-outage) states
From γ = {5, 2, 1, 0.5}, and γ_min = 1:

- γ = 5 → ✅ active (≥ 1)
- γ = 2 → ✅ active
- γ = 1 → ✅ active
- γ = 0.5 → ❌ outage (< 1)

So, only the first three states contribute to the average rate.

---

### Step 2: Compute rate for each active state
Assuming a Gaussian channel, the capacity (in bits/sec/Hz) for SNR γ is:

\[
C(\gamma) = \log_2(1 + \gamma)
\]

Compute for each active γ:

- For γ = 5:  
  \( C = \log_2(1 + 5) = \log_2(6) \approx 2.58496 \)

- For γ = 2:  
  \( C = \log_2(3) \approx 1.58496 \)

- For γ = 1:  
  \( C = \log_2(2) = 1 \)

---

### Step 3: Compute outage capacity C/B
It’s the expected rate over all states where γ ≥ γ_min, weighted by their probabilities.

Note: The outage state (γ = 0.5) contributes 0, so we ignore it in the expectation.

So,

\[
\frac{C}{B} = \sum_{\gamma \geq \gamma_{\min}} p(\gamma) \cdot \log_2(1 + \gamma)

\[

"A (63,57) code: find parity bits and code rate.","To analyze the (63, 57) code:

### 1. **Parity Bits**
In a block code notation (n, k),  
- **n** = total length of the codeword (63)  
- **k** = number of information bits (57)

The number of **parity bits** is:
\[
n - k = 63 - 57 = 6
\]

✅ So, there are **6 parity bits**.

---

### 2. **Code Rate**
The **code rate** \( R \) is defined as:
\[
R = \frac{k}{n} = \frac{57}{63}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{57}{63} = \frac{19}{21} \approx 0.9048

Compute received power needed for DBPSK BER 10^{-5} at R_b=2 Mbit/s with N0=3.18×10^{-20} W/Hz. Use γ_b=ln(1/(2P_b)).,"We are asked to compute the **received power** \( P_r \) needed for a **DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying)** system to achieve a Bit Error Rate (BER) of \( 10^{-5} \), given:

- Bit rate \( R_b = 2 \, \text{Mbit/s} = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{bits/s} \)
- Noise power spectral density \( N_0 = 3.18 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- BER target: \( P_b = 10^{-5} \)
- Formula given:  
  \[
  \gamma_b = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2P_b}\right)
  \]
  where \( \gamma_b \) is the **energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio**, i.e., \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

---

### Step 1: Compute \( \gamma_b \)

Given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-5}
\]

Plug into the formula:
\[
\gamma_b = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-5}}\right) = \ln\left(\frac{1}{2 \times 10^{-5}}\right) = \ln(5 \times 10^4)
\]

Compute:
\[
\ln(5 \times 10^4) = \ln(5) + \ln(10^4) = \ln(5) + 4\ln(10)
\]
Use approximate values:
- \( \ln(5) \approx 1.6094 \)
- \( \ln(10) \approx 2.3026 \)

So:
\[
\gamma_b \approx 1.6094 + 4 \times 2.3026 = 1.6094 + 9.2104 = 10.8198
\]

Thus,
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \gamma_b \approx 10.82
\]

---

### Step 2: Relate \( E_b \) to \( P_r \)

The energy per bit is:
\[
E_b = \frac{P_r}{R_b}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{P_r}{R_b N_0}
\]

Set this equal to \( \gamma_b \):
\[
\frac{P_r}{R_b N_0} = \gamma_b
\]

Solve for \( P_r \):
\[
P_r = \gamma_b \cdot R_b \cdot N_0
\]

Plug in the values:
- \( \gamma_b = 10.82 \)
- \( R_b = 2 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( N_0 = 3.18 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

\[
P_r = 10.82 \times (2 \times 10^6) \times (3.18 \times 10^{-20})
\]

First multiply constants:
\[
10.82 \times 2 = 21.64 \\
21.64 \times 3.18 = ?
\]

Calculate:
\[
21.64 \times 3.18 = (20 \times 3.18) + (1.64 \times 3.18) = 63.6 + 5.2272 = 68.8272
\]

Now include the powers of 10:
\[
P_r = 68.8272 \times 10^{6 - 20} = 68.8272 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{W}
\]

So:
\[
P_r \approx 6.883 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{W}

"For the 192 kbit/s stream with NRZ, what is first-null bandwidth?","For a 192 kbit/s stream using NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) line coding, the first-null bandwidth can be determined based on the properties of the NRZ signal.

In NRZ line coding:
- The signal transitions between two levels (e.g., +V and -V or 0 and 1) to represent binary data.
- The first null in the power spectral density (PSD) of an NRZ signal occurs at a frequency equal to the bit rate.

This is because the NRZ signal's spectrum has its first zero (null) at the bit rate due to the Fourier transform of a rectangular pulse train (which represents the NRZ waveform).

"Water-filling power allocation. γ0=0.6742, γ=0.2. Find S(γ)/S.","To solve this problem, we are asked to compute the ratio \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) in the context of **water-filling power allocation**, given:

- \( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \) (the water level or threshold)
- \( \gamma = 0.2 \) (a specific SNR or channel gain)

This is a classic problem in information theory and wireless communications, where:

- \( S \) is the total available power.
- \( S(\gamma) \) is the power allocated to a channel with SNR \( \gamma \), under the water-filling strategy.

---

### Water-Filling Power Allocation:
In water-filling, the optimal power allocation for a channel with SNR \( \gamma_i \) is:

\[
P_i = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma_i} \right)^+
\]

where \( x^+ = \max(x, 0) \), and \( \gamma_0 \) is chosen such that the total power constraint is satisfied:

\[
\sum_i P_i = S
\]

But here, it's simpler — you're being asked to compute the **ratio** \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \), where:

- \( S(\gamma) \) is the power allocated to a single channel with SNR \( \gamma = 0.2 \),
- \( S \) is the total power used for water-filling over all channels.

However, since only one value of \( \gamma \) is provided, and no distribution of channels, we interpret this as:

> For a single channel with SNR \( \gamma = 0.2 \), what fraction of the total water-filled power \( S \) is allocated to it?

This implies that the system has a single channel (or perhaps we're considering a single ""bin"" in water-filling), so the total power \( S \) is exactly the power allocated to this channel:  
\[
S(\gamma) = P = \left( \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right)^+
\]

Given:
- \( \gamma_0 = 0.6742 \)
- \( \gamma = 0.2 \)

Compute:

\[
P = \left( \frac{1}{0.6742} - \frac{1}{0.2} \right)^+
= \left( 1.4835 - 5 \right)^+
= (-3.5165)^+ = 0
\]

So, \( S(\gamma) = 0 \), meaning no power is allocated to this channel under water-filling.

Therefore:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0}{S} = 0
\]

"For an AM/SSB squaring method: If s_SSB(t)=m(t)cosω_ct+\hat m(t)sinω_ct, compute the LPF output after squaring.","We are given a single-sideband (SSB) signal:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}(t) = m(t)\cos(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}(t)\sin(\omega_c t)
\]

where:
- \( m(t) \) is the message signal,
- \( \hat{m}(t) \) is the Hilbert transform of \( m(t) \),
- \( \omega_c \) is the carrier angular frequency.

We are to compute the **low-pass filtered (LPF) output after squaring** this SSB signal, i.e., find:

\[
y(t) = \text{LPF}\left[ s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) \right]
\]

---

### Step 1: Square the SSB signal

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = \left[ m(t)\cos(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}(t)\sin(\omega_c t) \right]^2
\]

Expand the square:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = m^2(t)\cos^2(\omega_c t) + 2m(t)\hat{m}(t)\cos(\omega_c t)\sin(\omega_c t) + \hat{m}^2(t)\sin^2(\omega_c t)
\]

Use trigonometric identities:

- \( \cos^2(\omega_c t) = \frac{1}{2}[1 + \cos(2\omega_c t)] \)
- \( \sin^2(\omega_c t) = \frac{1}{2}[1 - \cos(2\omega_c t)] \)
- \( 2\cos(\omega_c t)\sin(\omega_c t) = \sin(2\omega_c t) \)

Substitute:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = 
\frac{1}{2}m^2(t)[1 + \cos(2\omega_c t)] + m(t)\hat{m}(t)\sin(2\omega_c t) + \frac{1}{2}\hat{m}^2(t)[1 - \cos(2\omega_c t)]
\]

Group terms:

\[
= \frac{1}{2}m^2(t) + \frac{1}{2}\hat{m}^2(t) + \frac{1}{2}m^2(t)\cos(2\omega_c t) - \frac{1}{2}\hat{m}^2(t)\cos(2\omega_c t) + m(t)\hat{m}(t)\sin(2\omega_c t)
\]

So:

\[
s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}[m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t)]}_{\text{DC and baseband}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}[m^2(t) - \hat{m}^2(t)]\cos(2\omega_c t)}_{\text{upper sideband at } 2\omega_c} + \underbrace{m(t)\hat{m}(t)\sin(2\omega_c t)}_{\text{quadrature component}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Apply low-pass filter (LPF)

The LPF removes all components at or above \( 2\omega_c \). So it passes only the DC and baseband term:

\[
y(t) = \text{LPF}\left[ s_{\text{SSB}}^2(t) \right] = \frac{1}{2}[m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t)]
\]

This is the final result.

---

### Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{y(t) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ m^2(t) + \hat{m}^2(t) \right]}

This is the **baseband signal** recovered after squaring and low-pass filtering in an AM/SSB squaring detection method.

DBPSK over AWGN. Find required E_b/N_0 (in dB) for BER P_b=10^{-6}.,"To find the required \( E_b/N_0 \) (in dB) for a Binary Differential Phase Shift Keying (DBPSK) system over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel to achieve a bit error rate (BER) of \( P_b = 10^{-6} \), we use the known BER expression for DBPSK.

### BER Expression for DBPSK over AWGN:
\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

This formula is derived from the differential detection process and is valid for coherent detection of DBPSK, assuming ideal conditions (no timing errors, etc.).

---

### Step-by-step Solution:

We are given:
\[
P_b = 10^{-6}
\]

Substitute into the equation:
\[
10^{-6} = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
2 \times 10^{-6} = \exp\left(-\frac{E_b}{N_0}\right)
\]

Take natural logarithm on both sides:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = -\frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

Calculate:
\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-6}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-6}) = \ln(2) - 6 \ln(10)
\]
\[
= 0.6931 - 6 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 13.8156 = -13.1225
\]

So:
\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = -13.1225 \Rightarrow \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 13.1225
\]

Convert to dB:
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(13.1225) \approx 11.18 \, \text{dB}

- Threshold power: \( \gamma_{\text{th}} = -20 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal fading: \( \sigma = 6 \, \text{dB} \)
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.1 \)

This is a classic problem in wireless communications using **log-normal shadowing**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the outage definition
Outage occurs when the received power \( P_r \) falls below the threshold \( \gamma_{\text{th}} \). Assuming the received power follows a log-normal distribution:

\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]

So, the outage probability is:
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \Pr(P_r < \gamma_{\text{th}}) = \Phi\left( \frac{\gamma_{\text{th}} - \mu}{\sigma} \right)
\]
where \( \Phi(\cdot) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation
Given \( P_{\text{out}} = 0.1 \), we have:
\[
\Phi\left( \frac{-20 - \mu}{6} \right) = 0.1
\]

We now solve for \( \mu \).

---

### Step 3: Use inverse standard normal CDF
We need the z-value such that \( \Phi(z) = 0.1 \).  
From standard normal tables or using a calculator:
\[
z = \Phi^{-1}(0.1) \approx -1.2816
\]

So:
\[
\frac{-20 - \mu}{6} = -1.2816
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( \mu \)
Multiply both sides by 6:
\[
-20 - \mu = -7.6896
\]

Then:
\[
-\mu = -7.6896 + 20 = 12.3104
\]
\[
\mu = -12.3104 \, \text{dBm}

### ✅ Final Answer:

Need to halve bit rate overhead while keeping same coded bit rate; if current code rate is 1/2, what code rate would double throughput (ignoring other changes)?","To halve the bit rate overhead while keeping the same **coded bit rate**, you need to **double the code rate**.

### Given:
- Current code rate: \( R = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Goal: Halve the overhead → meaning, for the same amount of data, fewer redundant bits are added.
- Keep the **coded bit rate** the same (i.e., same total output bit rate after encoding).

### What does this mean?
- With \( R = \frac{1}{2} \), for every 1 information bit, you add 1 parity bit → total 2 coded bits per 1 info bit → 100% overhead.
- To halve the overhead, you want only **50% overhead** → that means for every 1 information bit, you add 0.5 parity bits → total 1.5 coded bits per info bit.

This corresponds to a code rate of:

Find maximum bit rate.,"To find the **maximum bit rate** for a QPSK signal with a raised-cosine roll-off filter (α = 0.4) that must fit within a baseband bandwidth of B = 60 kHz, we use the relationship between symbol rate and bandwidth for raised-cosine filtering.

---

### Step 1: Bandwidth formula for raised-cosine filter
For a raised-cosine pulse shape, the required bandwidth \( B \) is:

\[
B = \frac{R_s}{2} (1 + \alpha)
\]

Where:
- \( R_s \) = symbol rate (symbols per second),
- \( \alpha \) = roll-off factor (here, α = 0.4),
- \( B \) = total bandwidth (here, 60 kHz).

We solve for \( R_s \):

\[
R_s = \frac{2B}{1 + \alpha}
= \frac{2 \times 60\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.4}
= \frac{120\ \text{kHz}}{1.4}
≈ 85.714\ \text{ksymbols/s}

### Step-by-step:

1. **Sequence period** = number of chips in one period = 1023 chips

"Given noise power -121 dBm and required SNR 18 dB, find required received power.","To find the required received power, we use the relationship between Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), received signal power (Pr), and noise power (N):

\[
\text{SNR (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_r}{N}\right)
\]

Given:
- Noise power \( N = -121 \) dBm
- Required SNR = 18 dB

We want to solve for \( P_r \) (required received power in dBm).

### Step 1: Convert the SNR equation to linear form
\[
18 = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_r}{N}\right)
\]

Divide both sides by 10:
\[
1.8 = \log_{10}\left(\frac{P_r}{N}\right)
\]

Convert from log form:
\[
\frac{P_r}{N} = 10^{1.8} \approx 63.0957
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( P_r \)
\[
P_r = N \times 63.0957
\]

Substitute \( N = -121 \) dBm:

Now, convert -121 dBm to milliwatts (linear scale) first:
\[
N = 10^{-121/10} = 10^{-12.1} \approx 7.943 \times 10^{-13} \text{ mW}
\]

Then:
\[
P_r = 63.0957 \times 7.943 \times 10^{-13} \approx 5.01 \times 10^{-11} \text{ mW}
\]

Now convert back to dBm:
\[
P_r (\text{dBm}) = 10 \log_{10}(5.01 \times 10^{-11}) = 10 \log_{10}(5.01) + 10 \log_{10}(10^{-11})
\]
\[
= 10 \times 0.7 + (-110) = 7 - 110 = -103 \text{ dBm}

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Required received power = -103 dBm**

Alternatively, you can do this directly using dBm arithmetic:
\[

- \( h_r = 3 \, \text{m} \) (receive height),
- \( f_c = 1.8 \, \text{GHz} \) (carrier frequency),
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength.

### Step 1: Compute the wavelength \( \lambda \)

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f_c}
\]
where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light).

\[

- Post-detection SNR requirement: \( \text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = 40 \, \text{dB} = 10^{4} \)
- One-sided noise power spectral density: \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- Single-tone FM:
  - Modulating frequency: \( f_m = 5 \, \text{kHz} \)
  - Frequency deviation: \( \Delta f = 20 \, \text{kHz} \)
- Discriminator gain:  
  \[
  G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta), \quad \text{where } \beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m}
  \]
- FM bandwidth approximation:  
  \[
  B_{\text{FM}} \approx 2(\Delta f + f_m)
  \]

We are to find the required **demodulator input signal power** \( S_i \) (in watts).

---

### Step 1: Compute the modulation index \( \beta \)

\[
\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m} = \frac{20 \, \text{kHz}}{5 \, \text{kHz}} = 4
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute discriminator gain \( G_{\text{FM}} \)

\[
G_{\text{FM}} = 3\beta^2(1 + \beta) = 3 \cdot (4)^2 \cdot (1 + 4) = 3 \cdot 16 \cdot 5 = 240
\]

---

### Step 3: Compute the FM bandwidth \( B_{\text{FM}} \)

\[
B_{\text{FM}} = 2(\Delta f + f_m) = 2(20 + 5) = 2 \cdot 25 = 50 \, \text{kHz} = 5 \times 10^4 \, \text{Hz}
\]

This is the bandwidth over which the noise is integrated at the demodulator input.

---

### Step 4: Use the post-detection SNR formula for FM

The post-detection SNR for a single-tone FM system is approximately:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = G_{\text{FM}} \cdot \frac{S_i}{n_0 B_{\text{FM}}}
\]

We solve for \( S_i \):

\[
S_i = \frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{post}} \cdot n_0 \cdot B_{\text{FM}}}{G_{\text{FM}}}
\]

Plug in the values:

- \( \text{SNR}_{\text{post}} = 10^4 \)
- \( n_0 = 2 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- \( B_{\text{FM}} = 5 \times 10^4 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( G_{\text{FM}} = 240 \)

\[
S_i = \frac{10^4 \cdot (2 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (5 \times 10^4)}{240}
\]

Compute step-by-step:

- Numerator:
  \[
  10^4 \cdot 2 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 5 \times 10^4 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 10^{4 -11 + 4} = 10 \cdot 10^{-3} = 10^{-2}
  \]

- Then divide by 240:

\[
S_i = \frac{10^{-2}}{240} = \frac{1}{24000} \approx 4.167 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{W}
\]

"If IM3 equals desired at output 35 dBm, what is the input third-order intercept (IIP3) approximately, given 2-tone test at -6 dBm input produced Δ=30 dB between desired (20 dBm) and IM3 (-10 dBm)?","We are given:

- Desired output power (at output) = 35 dBm  
- Input power for the 2-tone test = -6 dBm  
- Output desired power (from the test) = 20 dBm  
- IM3 (third-order intermodulation product) at output = -10 dBm  
- Δ = 30 dB = difference between desired output (20 dBm) and IM3 (-10 dBm)

We need to find the **Input Third-Order Intercept Point (IIP3)**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship

In a 2-tone test, the relationship between the input signal level and the generated third-order intermodulation distortion (IM3) is governed by the fact that:
- The desired signal (fundamental) increases linearly with input.
- The IM3 increases at **3 times** the rate of the fundamental (i.e., +3 dB per +1 dB input).

Therefore, if you increase the input by 1 dB, the desired output increases by 1 dB, but the IM3 increases by 3 dB — so their difference (Δ) decreases by 2 dB.

This gives us:

\[
\Delta = \text{desired output} - \text{IM3 output} = 30\ \text{dB}
\]

At this point, the input power is -6 dBm.

The IIP3 is the theoretical input level where the desired signal and the IM3 would intersect (i.e., Δ = 0 dB). Since Δ decreases by 2 dB per 1 dB increase in input, we can calculate how much more input is needed to bring Δ from 30 dB down to 0 dB.

---

### Step 2: Calculate required input increase

Each 1 dB increase in input reduces Δ by 2 dB.

To reduce Δ from 30 dB to 0 dB, we need:
\[
\frac{30\ \text{dB}}{2\ \text{dB/dB}} = 15\ \text{dB}
\]

So, we must increase the input by 15 dB from the current -6 dBm.

\[
\text{IIP3} = -6\ \text{dBm} + 15\ \text{dB} = 9\ \text{dBm}
\]

"Angle modulation: given s(t)=cos(ω_c t + 40 cos ω_m t). If it is FM with sensitivity K_FM=4 (rad/(V·s)), find modulating signal f(t).","We are given an angle-modulated signal:

\[
s(t) = \cos(\omega_c t + 40 \cos \omega_m t)
\]

This is in the form of a **frequency-modulated (FM)** signal:

\[
s(t) = \cos\left( \omega_c t + K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau) \, d\tau \right)
\]

where:
- \( \omega_c \) is the carrier frequency,
- \( K_{FM} \) is the frequency sensitivity (in rad/(V·s)),
- \( f(t) \) is the modulating signal (voltage).

From the given expression:

\[
s(t) = \cos(\omega_c t + 40 \cos \omega_m t)
\]

we can match this to the general FM form by identifying the phase deviation:

\[
\phi(t) = 40 \cos \omega_m t
\]

But in FM, the phase deviation is:
\[
\phi(t) = K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau) \, d\tau
\]

So we have:
\[
K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau) \, d\tau = 40 \cos \omega_m t
\]

Now solve for \( f(t) \). Take the derivative of both sides with respect to time:

\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ K_{FM} \int_0^t f(\tau)\,d\tau \right] = \frac{d}{dt} [40 \cos \omega_m t]

\[
K_{FM} f(t) = -40 \omega_m \sin \omega_m t

Solve for \( f(t) \):

\[
f(t) = \frac{-40 \omega_m}{K_{FM}} \sin \omega_m t

Given \( K_{FM} = 4 \) rad/(V·s), substitute:

\[

  \frac{p_{\text{total}}}{\gamma_0} = 1 + \sum \frac{p_i}{\gamma_i}

Assuming \( p_{\text{total}} = 1 \) (since the probabilities sum to 1), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\frac{1}{\gamma_0} = 1 + \sum \frac{p_i}{\gamma_i}

"For coherent OOK with equal priors, show the optimal threshold in terms of E_s.","For Coherent On-Off Keying (OOK) with equal priors, we want to find the optimal threshold for minimizing the probability of error when detecting whether a signal was transmitted or not.

### System Setup:
- Binary signaling:  
  - \( s_0(t) = 0 \) (no signal — ""off"")  
  - \( s_1(t) = \sqrt{E_s} \phi(t) \) (signal present — ""on"")  
  where \( \phi(t) \) is a unit-energy pulse, and \( E_s \) is the energy per symbol.
- Equal a priori probabilities: \( P(s_0) = P(s_1) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN): \( n(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, N_0/2) \)
- Receiver uses coherent detection: correlator output at decision time is  
  \( r = \int_{0}^{T} r(t)\phi(t) dt \)

The received signal is:
- If \( s_0 \): \( r = n \)
- If \( s_1 \): \( r = \sqrt{E_s} + n \)

So the decision variable \( r \) has two distributions:
- \( p(r|s_0) = \mathcal{N}(0, N_0/2) \)
- \( p(r|s_1) = \mathcal{N}(\sqrt{E_s}, N_0/2) \)

### Optimal Threshold via MAP Rule:
Since priors are equal, the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule reduces to Maximum Likelihood (ML):

\[
\text{Decide } s_1 \text{ if } p(r|s_1) > p(r|s_0)
\]

Take the log-likelihood ratio:

\[
\log \frac{p(r|s_1)}{p(r|s_0)} = \frac{(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2}{N_0} - \frac{r^2}{N_0}
= \frac{r^2 - 2r\sqrt{E_s} + E_s - r^2}{N_0}
= \frac{-2r\sqrt{E_s} + E_s}{N_0}
\]

Set this > 0 for deciding \( s_1 \):

\[
-2r\sqrt{E_s} + E_s > 0
\Rightarrow r < \frac{\sqrt{E_s}}{2}
\]

Wait! This gives **the condition to decide s₁** as \( r < \frac{\sqrt{E_s}}{2} \), so the decision boundary is at:

\[
\boxed{\gamma = \frac{\sqrt{E_s}}{2}}
\]

But let's double-check the inequality direction. The correct approach is to find where likelihoods are equal:

Set \( p(r|s_1) = p(r|s_0) \):

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi N_0}} \exp\left( -\frac{(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2}{N_0} \right) 
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi N_0}} \exp\left( -\frac{r^2}{N_0} \right)
\]

Take logs:

\[
-\frac{(r - \sqrt{E_s})^2}{N_0} = -\frac{r^2}{N_0}
\Rightarrow (r - \sqrt{E_s})^2 = r^2
\Rightarrow r^2 - 2r\sqrt{E_s} + E_s = r^2
\Rightarrow -2r\sqrt{E_s} + E_s = 0
\Rightarrow r = \frac{\sqrt{E_s}}{2}

M = 2^{4.5} = 2^4 \times 2^{0.5} = 16 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 16 \times 1.4142 \approx 22.627
\]

Since \( M \) must be an integer (number of constellation points in modulation), we round to the nearest valid integer.

- \( M = 22 \): \( \log_2(22) \approx 4.459 \) → \( \eta = 4.459 / 1.5 \approx 2.973 \) bit/s/Hz  
- \( M = 23 \): \( \log_2(23) \approx 4.523 \) → \( \eta = 4.523 / 1.5 \approx 3.015 \) bit/s/Hz  

So, to meet or exceed 3 bit/s/Hz, we need:

✅ **M = 23**

"(Extra) Shannon spectral efficiency. If SNR=15 dB, compute C/B in bit/s/Hz.","To compute the **Shannon spectral efficiency** \( \frac{C}{B} \) in bits per second per Hertz (bit/s/Hz), we use the **Shannon-Hartley theorem**:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Therefore, the spectral efficiency is:

\[
\frac{C}{B} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Given:
- SNR = 15 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to a linear scale:

\[

- \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10 \)

### Step-by-step:
1. Compute the argument of the Q-function:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.1623

Required SNR from target spectral efficiency. Need C/B=4 bit/s/Hz. Find SNR (linear and dB).,"To find the required SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) for a target spectral efficiency of **C/B = 4 bit/s/Hz**, we can use the fundamental relationship between spectral efficiency and SNR in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.

---

### 🔍 Key Formula:
For a capacity-limited channel (Shannon-Hartley Theorem):

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity (bit/s)
- \( B \) = bandwidth (Hz)
- \( \text{SNR} \) = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

Divide both sides by \( B \) to get spectral efficiency:

\[
\frac{C}{B} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Given:
\[
\frac{C}{B} = 4 \text{ bit/s/Hz}
\]

So:

\[
4 = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

### Step-by-step calculation:

1. Multiply \( f_D \) and \( \Delta t \):
\[
f_D \Delta t = 200 \times 0.5 \times 10^{-3} = 100 \times 10^{-3} = 0.1

- Transmitted power: \( P_t = 10 \, \text{mW} = 10^{-2} \, \text{W} \)
- Path loss exponent: \( \gamma = 4 \)
- Reference path loss coefficient: \( K = 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \)
- Noise power: \( N = 10^{-20} \, \text{W} \)
- Required SNR: \( \text{SNR} = 20 \, \text{dB} = 100 \) (linear scale)

We want to find the distance \( d \) (in meters) such that:

\[
\frac{P_r}{N} = 100
\]

---

### Step 1: Single-slope path loss model

The received power is modeled as:

\[
P_r = \frac{P_t}{K \cdot d^\gamma}
\]

Substitute into the SNR condition:

\[
\frac{P_r}{N} = \frac{P_t}{K \cdot d^\gamma \cdot N} = 100
\]

Solve for \( d \):

\[
d^\gamma = \frac{P_t}{K \cdot N \cdot 100}
\]

Now plug in the values:

- \( P_t = 10^{-2} \)
- \( K = 5.70 \times 10^{-4} \)
- \( N = 10^{-20} \)
- \( 100 = 10^2 \)

So:

\[
d^4 = \frac{10^{-2}}{(5.70 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot (10^{-20}) \cdot 10^2}
\]

First, simplify denominator:

\[
(5.70 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot (10^{-20}) \cdot (10^2) = 5.70 \times 10^{-22}
\]

Now:

\[
d^4 = \frac{10^{-2}}{5.70 \times 10^{-22}} = \frac{1}{5.70} \times 10^{20}
\]

\[
d^4 \approx 0.17544 \times 10^{20} = 1.7544 \times 10^{19}
\]

Take the fourth root:

\[
d = \left(1.7544 \times 10^{19}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Break it down:

\[
d = \left(1.7544\right)^{1/4} \times \left(10^{19}\right)^{1/4}
\]

- \( (10^{19})^{1/4} = 10^{19/4} = 10^{4.75} \approx 5623.41 \)
- \( (1.7544)^{1/4} \approx \sqrt{\sqrt{1.7544}} \approx \sqrt{1.324} \approx 1.151 \)

So:

\[
d \approx 1.151 \times 5623.41 \approx 6472.6 \, \text{m}

An AWGN channel has capacity C=1 Mbit/s and bandwidth B=200 kHz. Find required SNR (dB).,"To find the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in dB for an AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) channel, we use the Shannon-Hartley theorem:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) = channel capacity = 1 Mbit/s = \( 1 \times 10^6 \) bits per second  
- \( B \) = bandwidth = 200 kHz = \( 200 \times 10^3 \) Hz  
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not in dB)

### Step 1: Plug values into the formula
\[
1 \times 10^6 = 200 \times 10^3 \cdot \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( \log_2(1 + \text{SNR}) \)
\[
\log_2(1 + \text{SNR}) = \frac{10^6}{200 \times 10^3} = \frac{1000000}{200000} = 5

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

and we are asked to find \(\gamma_b\) in dB when \(P_b = 10^{-4}\).

---

### Step 1: Plug in \(P_b = 10^{-4}\)

\[
10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2} \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(\gamma_b\)

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-4} = \exp\left(-\frac{\gamma_b}{2}\right)
\]

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = -\frac{\gamma_b}{2}
\]

Compute the left-hand side:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-4}) = \ln(2) - 4\ln(10)
\]

Use approximate values:
- \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\)
- \(\ln(10) \approx 2.3026\)

So:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) \approx 0.6931 - 4 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 9.2104 = -8.5173
\]

Now solve for \(\gamma_b\):

\[
-\frac{\gamma_b}{2} = -8.5173 \Rightarrow \gamma_b = 2 \times 8.5173 = 17.0346
\]

### Step 3: Convert to dB

\(\gamma_b\) in dB is just the value in linear scale (since it's already a signal-to-noise ratio in dB form — note that \(\gamma_b = E_b/N_0\)).

So:

\[
\gamma_b (\text{dB}) = 17.0346 \, \text{dB}

\[
p_b \approx \frac{4}{\log_2 64} \left(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{64}}\right) Q\left( \sqrt{ \frac{3 \log_2 64}{64 - 1} \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0} } \right)
\]

And we're told to use \( E_b/N_0 = 18 \, \text{dB} \), and to estimate \( p_b \) using the **dominant Q term** — meaning we just compute the expression as given, assuming the Q-function dominates the error rate.

---

### Step 1: Compute constants
- \( \log_2 64 = 6 \)  
- \( \sqrt{64} = 8 \)

Plug into the formula:

\[
p_b \approx \frac{4}{6} \left(1 - \frac{1}{8}\right) Q\left( \sqrt{ \frac{3 \cdot 6}{63} \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0} } \right)
\]

Simplify:
- \( \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( 1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \)
- So coefficient: \( \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{8} = \frac{14}{24} = \frac{7}{12} \)

Now the argument of the Q-function:
- \( \frac{3 \cdot 6}{63} = \frac{18}{63} = \frac{6}{21} = \frac{2}{7} \)

So now:
\[
p_b \approx \frac{7}{12} \cdot Q\left( \sqrt{ \frac{2}{7} \cdot \frac{E_b}{N_0} } \right)
\]

---

### Step 2: Convert \( E_b/N_0 = 18 \, \text{dB} \) to linear scale

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{18/10} = 10^{1.8} = 63.0957
\]

Now plug into the square root:
\[
\sqrt{ \frac{2}{7} \cdot 63.0957 } = \sqrt{ \frac{126.1914}{7} } = \sqrt{18.0273} \approx 4.246
\]

---

### Step 3: Evaluate the Q-function

We need \( Q(4.246) \). Use approximation or known values:

From standard Q-function tables or approximations:

- \( Q(4) \approx 3.17 \times 10^{-5} \)
- \( Q(4.25) \approx 1.15 \times 10^{-5} \)

Use interpolation or a better estimate:

A common approximation for \( Q(x) \) for large \( x \):

\[
Q(x) \approx \frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2 / 2}
\]

But that's not very accurate at x=4.25. Better to use known value or calculator:

Using standard Q-function value:

\[
Q(4.246) \approx 1.20 \times 10^{-5}
\]

(You can verify this with MATLAB `qfunc(4.246)` or online Q-function calculator.)

---

### Step 4: Final calculation

\[
p_b \approx \frac{7}{12} \times 1.20 \times 10^{-5} = 0.5833 \times 1.20 \times 10^{-5} \approx 7.00 \times 10^{-6}

- User 1 is decoded first (so we assume successive cancellation, and user 2’s signal is treated as noise for user 1)

The capacity for user 1 when decoded first is:

\[
C_1 = B \log_2\left(1 + \frac{P_1}{P_2 + N}\right)

Substitute the values:

\[
C_1 = 10 \times 10^6 \cdot \log_2\left(1 + \frac{5}{5 + 1}\right)

\[
s(t) = A_c \cos\left(2\pi f_c t + \beta \sin(2\pi f_m t)\right)

This is a standard frequency-modulated (FM) signal where:

- \( A_c \): amplitude (not needed for deviation),
- \( f_c \): carrier frequency,
- \( f_m \): modulating frequency,
- \( \beta \): modulation index,
- The phase term is \( \phi(t) = \beta \sin(2\pi f_m t) \).

---

### Step 1: Recall the definition of frequency deviation

The **instantaneous frequency** \( f_i(t) \) of an FM wave is defined as:

\[
f_i(t) = f_c + \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}
\]

So, the **peak frequency deviation** \( \Delta f \) is the maximum deviation from the carrier frequency \( f_c \), i.e.,

\[
\Delta f = \max \left| \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} \right|
\]

---

### Step 2: Differentiate the phase term

Given:
\[
\phi(t) = \beta \sin(2\pi f_m t)
\]

Differentiate with respect to time:

\[
\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} = \beta \cdot 2\pi f_m \cos(2\pi f_m t)
\]

So,

\[
\frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} = \beta f_m \cos(2\pi f_m t)
\]

---

### Step 3: Find peak deviation

The maximum value of \( \cos(\cdot) \) is 1, so:

\[
\Delta f = \max \left| \beta f_m \cos(2\pi f_m t) \right| = \beta f_m
\]

---

### Step 4: Plug in values

Given:
- \( \beta = 6 \)

\Delta f = 6 \times 4000 = 24,000 \text{ Hz} = 24 \text{ kHz}

  \]
- The Q-function approximation for small \( x \):  
  \[

  \]
- For coherent 2ASK, the theoretical BER is:
  \[
  P_e = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \right)
  \]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \). Then:
\[
Q(x) = 0.45
\]

Using the small-\(x\) approximation:
\[
Q(x) \approx \frac{1}{2} - \frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi}} = 0.45

  \]

Our goal: Find the **minimum linear S/N** (i.e., \( \frac{S}{N} \)) such that \( P_b \leq 10^{-6} \).

---

### Step 1: Use the Q-function definition
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

We want:
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{S}{N}}\right) \leq 10^{-6}
\]

This implies:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{S}{N}} \geq Q^{-1}(10^{-6})
\]

So, we need to find the inverse Q-function value at \( 10^{-6} \).

---

### Step 2: Look up or approximate \( Q^{-1}(10^{-6}) \)

From standard Q-function tables or using approximations:

\[
Q^{-1}(10^{-6}) \approx 4.753

Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}\right) < 10^{-6}
\]

Our goal is to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB such that this inequality holds.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Q-function
The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

It gives the tail probability of a standard normal distribution.

We want:

\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}\right) < 10^{-6}
\]

Let’s set:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}}
\]
Then:
\[
Q(x) < 10^{-6}
\]

So we need to find the smallest \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \), and then solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \).

---

### Step 2: Find \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = 10^{-6} \)

From standard Q-function tables or using inverse Q-function approximations:

\[
Q(4.75) \approx 10^{-6}
\]

More precisely, using a calculator or software (e.g., MATLAB's `norminv` or Python's `scipy.stats.norm.ppf`):

- \( Q(4.753) \approx 10^{-6} \)

So set:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{4E_b}{N_0}} = 4.753
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{4E_b}{N_0} = (4.753)^2 \approx 22.59
\]

So:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{22.59}{4} = 5.6475
\]

---

### Step 4: Convert to dB

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(5.6475) \approx 10 \times 0.7518 \approx 7.52 \text{ dB}
\]

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{7.52} \text{ dB}
\]

This is the minimum \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB required to achieve \( Q(\sqrt{4E_b/N_0}) < 10^{-6} \) for QPSK.",7.52,0.0,0.018780400000000003
Compute orthogonal Δf for R_b=1200 bit/s.,"To compute the orthogonal Δf (frequency separation) for a given bit rate \( R_b = 1200 \) bit/s, we typically consider **Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM)** or **Minimum Shift Keying (MSK)**-like systems where orthogonality between subcarriers or symbols is maintained.

However, the most common context where ""orthogonal Δf"" is referenced in digital communications — especially with a given bit rate — is in **coherent binary FSK (Frequency Shift Keying)** or **Orthogonal FSK (OFSK)**, where:

- The frequency spacing between adjacent symbols (or subcarriers) must be an integer multiple of the symbol rate to ensure orthogonality.
- For binary FSK, the minimum frequency separation for orthogonality is \( \Delta f = \frac{R_b}{2} \) when using coherent detection and rectangular pulses.

### Standard Result:
For **coherent orthogonal FSK** (e.g., MSK or standard binary FSK), the **minimum required frequency separation** for orthogonality is:

\[
\Delta f = \frac{R_b}{2}
\]

Given:
\[
R_b = 1200 \text{ bit/s}
\]

Then:
\[
\Delta f = \frac{1200}{2} = 600 \text{ Hz}
\]

### ✅ Final Answer:
\[
\Delta f = 600 \text{ Hz}

Given:
- \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10 \, \text{dB} \)

---

### Step 1: Convert \( E_b/N_0 \) from dB to linear scale

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = 10^{10/10} = 10
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( \sin(\pi/8) \)

\[
\frac{\pi}{8} = 22.5^\circ \Rightarrow \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \sin(22.5^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2} \approx 0.382683
\]

(You can use a calculator or exact value: ≈ 0.3827)

---

### Step 3: Plug into the formula

First compute the argument of the Q-function:

\[
\sqrt{6 \cdot 10} \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{8}\right) = \sqrt{60} \cdot 0.382683
\]

\[
\sqrt{60} \approx 7.746
\]

\[
7.746 \times 0.382683 \approx 2.965
\]

So the argument is ≈ 2.965

---

### Step 4: Evaluate \( Q(2.965) \)

The Q-function is defined as:

\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q(2.965) \approx 0.00152

Outage strategy optimization (discrete). Same states as previous. Compare outage capacity for γ_min=3.162 vs γ_min=1 and pick larger. Provide both values.,"To optimize the outage strategy for discrete states and compare outage capacities at two different thresholds — γ_min = 3.162 and γ_min = 1 — we must:

1. **Define the outage capacity** for each threshold as:
   \[
   C_{\text{out}} = \mathbb{E}[\log(1 + \gamma)] \cdot \mathbb{P}(\gamma \geq \gamma_{\min})
   \]
   This is a standard model where:
   - \( \gamma \) is the channel gain (assumed to be in discrete states, e.g., from a finite set).
   - \( \gamma_{\min} \) is the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for successful transmission.
   - The outage occurs when \( \gamma < \gamma_{\min} \), so we only transmit when \( \gamma \geq \gamma_{\min} \).

2. **Assume same discrete states** as in the previous problem — let’s denote them as \( \gamma_1, \gamma_2, ..., \gamma_N \), with probabilities \( p_1, p_2, ..., p_N \), where \( \sum p_i = 1 \).

Since you mentioned ""same states as previous"" but didn't provide the actual values, I will assume a typical example used in such problems:  
Let’s take the following discrete channel gains and their probabilities (common in textbook examples):

| State \( \gamma_i \) | Probability \( p_i \) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 0.5                 | 0.1                   |
| 1.0                 | 0.2                   |
| 2.0                 | 0.3                   |
| 4.0                 | 0.25                  |
| 8.0                 | 0.15                  |

Now compute outage capacity for both thresholds:

---

### Case 1: γ_min = 3.162

- States where \( \gamma_i \geq 3.162 \): only \( \gamma = 4.0 \) and \( \gamma = 8.0 \)
- Probabilities: \( p(4.0) = 0.25 \), \( p(8.0) = 0.15 \)
- Total probability of no outage: \( P_{\text{no outage}} = 0.25 + 0.15 = 0.4 \)

Outage capacity:
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(3.162)} = \sum_{\gamma_i \geq 3.162} p_i \log_2(1 + \gamma_i)
= 0.25 \cdot \log_2(5) + 0.15 \cdot \log_2(9)
\]

Calculate:
- \( \log_2(5) \approx 2.3219 \)
- \( \log_2(9) \approx 3.1699 \)

So:
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(3.162)} = 0.25 \cdot 2.3219 + 0.15 \cdot 3.1699
= 0.5805 + 0.4755 = 1.056 \text{ bits/channel use}
\]

---

### Case 2: γ_min = 1

- States where \( \gamma_i \geq 1 \): all except \( \gamma = 0.5 \)
- Probabilities: \( 1 - p(0.5) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9 \)

Outage capacity:
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(1)} = \sum_{\gamma_i \geq 1} p_i \log_2(1 + \gamma_i)
\]

Compute:
- For \( \gamma = 1.0 \): \( p = 0.2 \), \( \log_2(2) = 1 \)
- For \( \gamma = 2.0 \): \( p = 0.3 \), \( \log_2(3) \approx 1.58496 \)
- For \( \gamma = 4.0 \): \( p = 0.25 \), \( \log_2(5) \approx 2.3219 \)
- For \( \gamma = 8.0 \): \( p = 0.15 \), \( \log_2(9) \approx 3.1699 \)

Sum:
\[
C_{\text{out}}^{(1)} = 0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.3 \cdot 1.585 + 0.25 \cdot 2.322 + 0.15 \cdot 3.170

A raised-cosine shaped QPSK system must fit into B=25 kHz with roll-off α=0.25. Find maximum bit rate.,"To find the **maximum bit rate** for a raised-cosine shaped QPSK system, we use the relationship between bandwidth, roll-off factor, and symbol rate.

### Given:
- Bandwidth \( B = 25 \) kHz
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.25 \)
- Modulation: QPSK → each symbol carries 2 bits

---

### Step 1: Find the Symbol Rate \( R_s \)

For a raised-cosine filter, the bandwidth is:

\[
B = R_s \cdot \frac{1 + \alpha}{2}
\]

Solving for \( R_s \):

### Step 2: Find Bit Rate \( R_b \)

Since QPSK transmits 2 bits per symbol:

\[
R_b = 2 \times R_s = 2 \times 40 \text{ kbps} = 80 \text{ kbps}

- Threshold power: \( P_{\text{th}} = 10 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Standard deviation of log-normal shadowing: \( \sigma = 12 \, \text{dB} \)
- Outage probability: \( P_{\text{out}} = 1\% = 0.01 \)

This is a classic problem in wireless communication using **log-normal shadowing**.

---

### Step 1: Log-normal model
The received power \( P_r \) follows a log-normal distribution:
\[
P_r \sim \mathcal{LN}(\mu, \sigma^2)
\]
In dBm, this means the logarithm of the power (i.e., \( \log_{10}(P_r) \)) is normally distributed with mean \( \mu \) and standard deviation \( \sigma \).

Outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \), so:
\[
P(P_r < P_{\text{th}}) = 0.01
\]

Convert to the standard normal variable \( Z \):
\[
P\left( \frac{\log_{10}(P_r) - \mu}{\sigma} < \frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.01
\]

Let \( X = \log_{10}(P_r) \), then \( X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2) \), so:
\[
P(X < \log_{10}(P_{\text{th}})) = 0.01
\]

Standardize:
\[
P\left( Z < \frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} \right) = 0.01
\]

From standard normal tables:
- The z-score corresponding to cumulative probability 0.01 is approximately \( z = -2.326 \)

So:
\[
\frac{\log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) - \mu}{\sigma} = -2.326
\]

Solve for \( \mu \):
\[
\mu = \log_{10}(P_{\text{th}}) + 2.326 \cdot \sigma
\]

Plug in values:
- \( \log_{10}(10 \, \text{dBm}) = 1 \) (since \( 10^1 = 10 \))

- Frequency \( f = 2 \, \text{GHz} = 2 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz} \)
- Distance \( d = 50 \, \text{m} \)
- Received power \( P_r = -60 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Free-space path loss formula:  
  \[
  P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
  \]
  (This assumes isotropic antennas — no gain.)

We are to find the required transmit power \( P_t \) in watts.

---

### Step 1: Convert received power to watts

\( P_r = -60 \, \text{dBm} \)

Recall:
\[
P_r (\text{W}) = 10^{(P_r_{\text{dBm}} - 30)/10}
\]

So:
\[
P_r = 10^{(-60 - 30)/10} = 10^{-9} \, \text{W} = 1 \, \text{nW}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate wavelength \( \lambda \)

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}}{2 \times 10^9 \, \text{Hz}} = 0.15 \, \text{m}
\]

---

### Step 3: Plug into the path loss formula

\[
P_r = P_t \left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi d} \right)^2
\]

Solve for \( P_t \):

\[
P_t = P_r \left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)^2
\]

Substitute values:

- \( P_r = 10^{-9} \, \text{W} \)
- \( d = 50 \, \text{m} \)
- \( \lambda = 0.15 \, \text{m} \)

First compute the ratio:

\[
\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} = \frac{4 \pi \cdot 50}{0.15} = \frac{200\pi}{0.15} = \frac{200 \cdot 3.1416}{0.15} \approx \frac{628.32}{0.15} \approx 4188.8
\]

Now square it:

\[
\left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)^2 \approx (4188.8)^2 \approx 17,546,000

Now compute \( P_t \):

\[
P_t = 10^{-9} \times 17,546,000 = 1.7546 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{W} = 17.55 \, \text{mW}

- **Threshold** \( P_{\text{th}} = 5 \, \text{dBm} \)

Outage occurs when \( P_r < P_{\text{th}} \).

Since \( P_r \) is log-normally distributed, its logarithm (in dB) is normally distributed:

Let \( X = \log_{10}(P_r) \) — but in practice, we work directly with dB values.

So, define:
- \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 15, \sigma = 8) \) in dBm

Add 1 to both sides:

\[

"Coherent 16-QAM union-bound inversion. For p_b=10^{-3}, estimate required E_b/N_0 in dB using p_b≈(3/4)Q(\sqrt{(4/5)\gamma_b}).","We are given a bit error probability estimate for 16-QAM using a union bound approximation:

\[
p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right)
\]

where:
- \( p_b = 10^{-3} \)
- \( \gamma_b = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) (energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio, in linear scale)

Our goal is to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB.

---

### Step 1: Plug in \( p_b = 10^{-3} \)

\[
10^{-3} = \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right)
\]

Solve for the Q-function argument:

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right) = \frac{4}{3} \times 10^{-3} = \frac{4}{3000} = \frac{1}{750}
\]

So:

\[
Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \right) = \frac{1}{750}
\]

Now use the inverse Q-function (also called the Q⁻¹ function), which gives the input \( x \) such that \( Q(x) = p \). We need:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} = Q^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{750} \right)
\]

Let’s compute \( Q^{-1}(1/750) \).

Note:  
- \( Q(3.09) \approx 0.001 \) (since \( Q(3) \approx 0.00135 \), \( Q(3.1) \approx 0.00097 \))
- So, \( Q^{-1}(0.001) \approx 3.09 \)

But we have \( Q^{-1}(1/750) = Q^{-1}(0.001333...) \)

Let’s interpolate or use known values:

| \( x \) | \( Q(x) \) |
|--------|------------|
| 3.0    | ~0.00135   |
| 3.1    | ~0.00097   |

We want \( Q(x) = 0.001333 \), so it's between 3.0 and 3.1.

Use linear interpolation (roughly):

- At \( x = 3.0 \): \( Q = 0.00135 \)
- At \( x = 3.1 \): \( Q = 0.00097 \)
- Difference in x: 0.1
- Difference in Q: 0.00038

We want to go from 0.00135 down to 0.001333 → delta = -0.000017

Fraction of interval:  
\[
\frac{0.000017}{0.00038} \approx 0.0447
\]

So \( x \approx 3.0 + 0.0447 \times 0.1 \approx 3.0 + 0.00447 = 3.00447 \)

Thus:  
\[
\sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b} \approx 3.0045
\]

Now square both sides:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \gamma_b = (3.0045)^2 \approx 9.027
\Rightarrow \gamma_b = \frac{5}{4} \times 9.027 = 1.25 \times 9.027 \approx 11.284
\]

Now convert to dB:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ (dB)} = 10 \log_{10}(11.284) \approx 10 \times 1.0525 \approx 10.53 \, \text{dB}

We need to find \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) such that:

\[

\]

Step 1: Find the argument of the Q-function

From Q-function tables or using a calculator:

\[
Q(z) = 0.01 \Rightarrow z \approx 2.326
\]

So:

\[

\]

Step 2: Solve for \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \):

\[
\frac{2E_b}{N_0} = (2.326)^2 \approx 5.41
\]
\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} \approx \frac{5.41}{2} = 2.705

Step 3: Convert to dB:

\[

More precisely:
\[
2^{40} = 1,099,511,627,776 \approx 1.0995 \times 10^{12}

- Number of levels: \( M = 64 \)
- SQNR formula in dB:

### Step-by-step calculation:
\[
\text{SQNR (dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(64)
\]

First, compute \( \log_{10}(64) \):

Since \( 64 = 2^6 \), we have:

\[
C = B \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

Where:
- \( C \) is the channel capacity in bits per second (bit/s),
- \( B \) is the bandwidth in Hz,
- SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio (as a linear ratio, not in dB).

---

**Given:**
- Bandwidth \( B = 3.4 \) kHz = 3400 Hz
- SNR = 20 dB

First, convert SNR from decibels to a linear scale:

\[
\text{SNR}_{\text{linear}} = 10^{\frac{\text{SNR}_{\text{dB}}}{10}} = 10^{\frac{20}{10}} = 10^2 = 100
\]

Now plug into the Shannon formula:

\[
C = 3400 \times \log_2(1 + 100) = 3400 \times \log_2(101)
\]

Calculate \( \log_2(101) \):

\[

---

### Step 2: Plug into the formula
\[
p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{4}{5} \cdot 25.1189} \right)

First compute the argument of the Q-function:

\[
\frac{4}{5} \cdot 25.1189 = 20.0951
\]
\[
\sqrt{20.0951} \approx 4.483
\]

So:
\[
p_b \approx \frac{3}{4} Q(4.483)

### Step 3: Evaluate \( Q(4.483) \)

The Q-function is defined as:
\[

### Step 1: Calculate Input Noise Power \( N_i \)

For a single-tone AM modulation with bandwidth \( 2f_m \), the input noise power is:

\[
N_i = n_0 \cdot 2f_m
\]

Substitute values:

\[
N_i = (2 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 2 \cdot (4 \times 10^3) = (2 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 8 \times 10^3 = 16 \times 10^{-7} = 1.6 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{W}

So,
\[

---

### Step 3: Compute AM System Gain \( G_{AM} \)

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{2\beta^2}{2 + \beta^2}
\]

Substitute \( \beta^2 = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
G_{AM} = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2}{3}}{2 + \frac{2}{3}} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}}{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{4}{8} = 0.5

- Signal levels: 0 and A  
- Prior probabilities:  
  - P(0) = 0.8  
  - P(A) = 0.2  
- Signal amplitude: A = 0.4  
- Noise variance: N₀/2 → so N₀ = 0.08  

We are to compute the MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) threshold voltage \( V_T \), using the formula:

\[
V_T = \frac{A}{2} + \frac{N_0}{2A} \ln\left(\frac{P(0)}{P(A)}\right)
\]

---

### Step 1: Plug in known values

- \( A = 0.4 \)  
- \( N_0 = 0.08 \)  
- \( \frac{P(0)}{P(A)} = \frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4 \)

PCM frame duration. Sampling frequency is 10 kHz. What is frame duration?,"The frame duration in a PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) system depends on how many samples are included in each frame. However, if we assume a typical case where **one frame contains one sample** (common in simple PCM systems), then:

- Sampling frequency = 10 kHz = 10,000 samples per second  
- Therefore, the time between consecutive samples (i.e., the frame duration) is:

\[
\text{Frame duration} = \frac{1}{\text{Sampling frequency}} = \frac{1}{10,000} = 0.0001 \text{ seconds} = 100 \text{ microseconds (μs)}
\]

✅ So, **if one frame = one sample**, the frame duration is **100 μs**.

If your system uses multiple samples per frame (e.g., 16 samples per frame), you’d divide accordingly. But since the question doesn't specify frame size, the standard assumption is one sample per frame.

- Baseband bandwidth \( B = 44.8 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor \( \alpha = 0.4 \)  
- For QPSK:  
  - Symbol rate \( R_s \) is related to bit rate \( R_b \) by \( R_b = 2R_s \)  
  - Bandwidth relation: \( B = \frac{(1 + \alpha) R_s}{2} \)

### Step 1: Solve for symbol rate \( R_s \) from the bandwidth formula

Given:
\[
B = \frac{(1 + \alpha) R_s}{2}
\]

Plug in values:
\[
44.8 \times 10^3 = \frac{(1 + 0.4) R_s}{2}

Coherent BPSK with carrier phase offset φ. Decision statistic means are ±A cosφ. What is optimal decision threshold (equal priors)?,"For a coherent BPSK system with a carrier phase offset φ, the decision statistic for each received symbol is a Gaussian random variable. The means of the decision statistics are:

- For bit 0 (assuming transmitted symbol is -A): mean = -A cosφ  
- For bit 1 (assuming transmitted symbol is +A): mean = +A cosφ  

This arises because the receiver correlates the received signal with a local oscillator that has a phase offset φ relative to the actual transmitted carrier.

Given equal priors (i.e., P(0) = P(1) = 0.5), the optimal decision threshold minimizes the total probability of error and is located at the midpoint between the two conditional means.

Therefore, the optimal decision threshold \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{(-A \cos\phi) + (A \cos\phi)}{2} = 0
\]

✅ **Answer: Optimal decision threshold = 0**

Even though there is a phase offset φ, the symmetry of the means around zero ensures that the optimal threshold remains at zero when priors are equal. However, note that while the threshold is still 0, the performance (error probability) degrades due to reduced signal-to-noise ratio in the effective decision metric — the distance between means becomes \( 2A |\cos\phi| \), reducing the signal margin.",0.0,0.0,0.026621849999999996
"For coherent 2ASK, if \sqrt{E_b/N0}=0.02, approximate BER using Q(x)≈0.5-x/\sqrt{2\pi}.","We are given:

- Approximation for the Q-function:  
  \[
  Q(x) \approx 0.5 - \frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \]

---

### Step 1: BER for coherent 2ASK
The bit error rate (BER) for coherent 2ASK is given by:
\[
P_b = Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} \right)
\]

Note:  
\(\sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 0.02\)

So:
\[
x = \sqrt{\frac{2E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot 0.02 \approx 1.4142 \times 0.02 = 0.028284
\]

---

### Step 2: Apply the approximation

Use the given approximation:
\[
Q(x) \approx 0.5 - \frac{x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
\]

First, compute \(\sqrt{2\pi}\):
\[
\sqrt{2\pi} \approx \sqrt{6.2832} \approx 2.5066
\]

Now plug in \(x = 0.028284\):

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)

with:
- Symbol rate \( R_s = 2 \times 10^6 \) baud
- Received amplitude \( A = 2 \, \text{mV} = 2 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{V} \)
- Double-sided noise power spectral density \( n_0 = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

We are also told to use:
- \( E_b = \frac{A^2}{4R_s} \)
- \( N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} \)

---

### Step 1: Calculate \( E_b \)

\[
E_b = \frac{A^2}{4R_s} = \frac{(2 \times 10^{-3})^2}{4 \times 2 \times 10^6}
= \frac{4 \times 10^{-6}}{8 \times 10^6}
= \frac{4}{8} \times 10^{-12}
= 0.5 \times 10^{-12}
= 5 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{J}
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate \( N_0 \)

\[
N_0 = \frac{n_0}{2} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-10}}{2} = 5 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{W/Hz}
\]

Note: Since \( N_0 \) has units of W/Hz, and \( E_b \) is in joules (which is watt-seconds), the ratio \( E_b / N_0 \) will be dimensionless — good for the Q-function.

---

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \)

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{5 \times 10^{-13}}{5 \times 10^{-11}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01
\]

So:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.1
\]

---

### Step 4: Evaluate \( P_b = Q(0.1) \)

The Q-function is defined as:
\[
Q(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_x^\infty e^{-t^2/2} dt
\]

For small \( x \), we can use approximations or known values. From standard tables or calculators:

"Water-filling normalized power allocation. Cutoff γ_0=0.8. For state γ=0.5, compute S(γ)/S.","To compute \( \frac{S(\gamma)}{S} \) for a water-filling normalized power allocation with cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \) and state \( \gamma = 0.5 \), we follow the principles of water-filling in multi-channel communication (e.g., OFDM or multiple parallel channels).

---

### Key Concepts:
- **Water-filling policy**: Allocates more power to channels with higher channel gains (i.e., higher \( \gamma \)).
- The total power is normalized such that the average power across all channels is 1 (i.e., \( S = \text{average power per channel} = 1 \)).
- The allocation for a given channel with gain \( \gamma \) is:

\[
P(\gamma) = \max\left(0, \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right)
\]

This is the standard water-filling formula when the noise power is normalized to 1.

But in this context, since it's about **normalized power allocation**, we’re interested in how much power is allocated to a channel with gain \( \gamma \), relative to the total average power \( S \). So we must compute:

\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S}
\]

Where:
- \( S(\gamma) \) is the power allocated to a channel with gain \( \gamma \),
- \( S \) is the average power over all channels — typically taken as 1 in normalized systems.

---

### Step-by-step Calculation:

Given:
- Cutoff \( \gamma_0 = 0.8 \)
- Channel gain \( \gamma = 0.5 \)

Check if \( \gamma < \gamma_0 \):

Since \( 0.5 < 0.8 \), the water-filling formula gives:

\[
P(\gamma) = \max\left(0, \frac{1}{\gamma_0} - \frac{1}{\gamma} \right) = \max\left(0, \frac{1}{0.8} - \frac{1}{0.5} \right)
= \max(0, 1.25 - 2) = \max(0, -0.75) = 0
\]

So, no power is allocated to this channel!

Therefore:
\[
S(\gamma) = 0
\]
\[
S = 1 \quad \text{(normalized average power)}
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{S(\gamma)}{S} = \frac{0}{1} = 0

- Channel bandwidth: \( B = 4 \) kHz  
- Roll-off factor: \( \alpha = 0.5 \)  
- Required bit rate: \( R_b = 16 \) kbit/s  

We need to find the **minimum modulation order \( M \)** (a power of 2) that satisfies this requirement, assuming a **Nyquist channel** (no ISI), and using **M-ary modulations** like QAM or PSK.

---

### Step 1: Determine maximum symbol rate
For a bandlimited channel with roll-off factor \( \alpha \), the **maximum symbol rate \( R_s \)** is:

\[
R_s = \frac{B}{1 + \alpha}
\]

Substitute values:

\[
R_s = \frac{4\ \text{kHz}}{1 + 0.5} = \frac{4}{1.5} = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.6667\ \text{k symbols/s}
\]

---

### Step 2: Find required bits per symbol

The bit rate and symbol rate are related by:

\[
R_b = R_s \cdot \log_2(M)
\]

Solve for \( \log_2(M) \):

\[
\log_2(M) = \frac{R_b}{R_s} = \frac{16\ \text{kbit/s}}{8/3\ \text{kSymbols/s}} = 16 \div \frac{8}{3} = 16 \times \frac{3}{8} = 6

So:

\[
\log_2(M) = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad M = 2^6 = 64

\[
E_b/N_0 = \left( \frac{S}{N} \right) \times \left( \frac{B}{R_b} \right)

Where:
- \( \frac{S}{N} \) = input Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in linear units (not dB),
- \( B \) = channel bandwidth = 3000 Hz,
- \( R_b \) = bit rate = 600 bit/s.

### Step 1: Convert SNR from dB to linear scale
Given:  
Input SNR = 3 dB

Convert to linear:

\[
\frac{S}{N} = 10^{(3/10)} = 10^{0.3} \approx 2

---

### Step 2: Compute the ratio \( \frac{B}{R_b} \)

  \[
  |R(\Delta f)| < 0.3

- Given \( \tau_{\text{rms}} = 1 \, \mu\text{s} = 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \)

---

### Step 1: Set up the inequality
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2}} < 0.3
\]

Take reciprocals on both sides (note: since both sides are positive, the inequality flips):

\[
\sqrt{1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2} > \frac{1}{0.3} = \frac{10}{3}
\]

Now square both sides:

\[
1 + (2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2 > \left( \frac{10}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{100}{9}
\]

Subtract 1:

\[
(2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}})^2 > \frac{100}{9} - 1 = \frac{91}{9}
\]

Take square root:

\[
2\pi \Delta f \tau_{\text{rms}} > \sqrt{\frac{91}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{91}}{3}
\]

Solve for \( \Delta f \):

\[
\Delta f > \frac{\sqrt{91}}{3 \cdot 2\pi \tau_{\text{rms}}} = \frac{\sqrt{91}}{6\pi \tau_{\text{rms}}}
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug in values

\( \tau_{\text{rms}} = 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \)

First compute \( \sqrt{91} \approx 9.5394 \)

Then:

\[
\Delta f > \frac{9.5394}{6\pi \cdot 10^{-6}} 
= \frac{9.5394}{6 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 10^{-6}} 
\approx \frac{9.5394}{18.8496 \cdot 10^{-6}} 
\approx \frac{9.5394}{1.88496 \times 10^{-5}}

Now calculate:

\[
\Delta f > \frac{9.5394}{1.88496 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 506,000 \, \text{Hz}

### Given:
- Input tone power: \( P_{\text{in}} = -10 \, \text{dBm} \)
- Desired output power (fundamental): \( P_{\text{out}} = 15 \, \text{dBm} \)
- IM3 output power: \( P_{\text{IM3}} = -25 \, \text{dBm} \)

First, calculate the gain:
\[
\text{Gain} = P_{\text{out}} - P_{\text{in}} = 15 - (-10) = 25 \, \text{dB}
\]

Now, convert the IM3 output to what it would be **at the input** level using the same gain:
\[
P_{\text{IM3, in}} = P_{\text{IM3}} - \text{Gain} = -25 - 25 = -50 \, \text{dBm}

"For OFDM with Pr(r>A0)=exp(-A0^2), find clipping probability when A0=2.","We are given:

- The probability that the received signal magnitude exceeds a threshold:  
  \( \Pr(r > A_0) = \exp(-A_0^2) \)

- We are asked to find the **clipping probability** when \( A_0 = 2 \)

---

### Step 1: Understand what ""clipping probability"" means in this context

In OFDM systems, clipping occurs when the signal amplitude exceeds a certain threshold (often the peak power limit of the power amplifier). The **clipping probability** is typically defined as:
\[
P_{\text{clip}} = \Pr(r > A_0)
\]
This represents the probability that the signal exceeds the clipping threshold \( A_0 \), leading to distortion.

Given:
\[
\Pr(r > A_0) = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

So, the clipping probability is simply:
\[
P_{\text{clip}} = \exp(-A_0^2)
\]

---

### Step 2: Plug in \( A_0 = 2 \)

\[
P_{\text{clip}} = \exp(-2^2) = \exp(-4)
\]

Now compute numerically:

\[
\exp(-4) \approx \frac{1}{e^4} \approx \frac{1}{54.598} \approx 0.0183

"Uniform quantizer: range -2 to +2 V, n=8 bits, endpoints included. Find step size Δ.","To find the step size Δ of a uniform quantizer:

Given:
- Range: from -2 V to +2 V
- Number of bits: n = 8
- Endpoints are included

### Step 1: Total number of levels
For an n-bit uniform quantizer, the total number of quantization levels is:

\[
L = 2^n = 2^8 = 256
\]

### Step 2: Total range
The total range is:

\[
\text{Range} = 2 - (-2) = 4 \text{ V}
\]

### Step 3: Step size Δ
Since the endpoints are included, the quantizer divides the range into \( L - 1 \) equal intervals (because with L levels, you have L−1 steps between them).

So:

\[
\Delta = \frac{\text{Range}}{L - 1} = \frac{4}{256 - 1} = \frac{4}{255}

\[
H_2(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2 (1 - p)

\[
H_2(0.08) = -0.08 \log_2(0.08) - 0.92 \log_2(0.92)
\]

We'll calculate each term:

- \( \log_2(0.08) = \frac{\ln(0.08)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-2.5257}{0.6931} \approx -3.644 \)
- So, \( -0.08 \times (-3.644) \approx 0.2915 \)

- \( \log_2(0.92) = \frac{\ln(0.92)}{\ln(2)} \approx \frac{-0.0834}{0.6931} \approx -0.1203 \)

Matched filter for pulse s(t)=A[U(t)-U(t-T/3)]. Find h(t)=s(T-t).,"We are given a pulse signal:

\[
s(t) = A \left[ U(t) - U\left(t - \frac{T}{3}\right) \right]
\]

This is a rectangular pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = 0 \) and ending at \( t = \frac{T}{3} \). The unit step function \( U(t) \) ensures it's zero before \( t = 0 \) and after \( t = \frac{T}{3} \).

### Step 1: Understand the matched filter
The impulse response \( h(t) \) of a matched filter for a signal \( s(t) \) is defined as:

\[
h(t) = s(T - t)
\]

So, we need to compute \( s(T - t) \).

---

### Step 2: Substitute \( T - t \) into \( s(t) \)

\[
h(t) = s(T - t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( (T - t) - \frac{T}{3} \right) \right]
\]

Simplify the second term:

\[
(T - t) - \frac{T}{3} = \frac{2T}{3} - t
\]

So,

\[
h(t) = A \left[ U(T - t) - U\left( \frac{2T}{3} - t \right) \right]
\]

---

### Step 3: Interpret the result

This expression represents a **rectangular pulse** that:
- Starts at \( t = \frac{2T}{3} \) (because \( U\left(\frac{2T}{3} - t\right) \) becomes 0 when \( t > \frac{2T}{3} \))
- Ends at \( t = T \) (because \( U(T - t) \) becomes 0 when \( t > T \))

So, \( h(t) \) is a pulse of amplitude \( A \), starting at \( t = \frac{2T}{3} \) and ending at \( t = T \).

In other words, it's a time-reversed and delayed version of \( s(t) \), as expected from the matched filter concept.

s(t) = 6 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 10^6 \, t + 2\pi \cdot 4000 \cdot \frac{1}{5000\pi} \sin(10000\pi t) \right)
\]

Simplify the modulation index term:

\[
2\pi \cdot 4000 \cdot \frac{1}{5000\pi} = \frac{8000\pi}{5000\pi} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6
\]

So the final FM signal expression is:

\[
\boxed{s(t) = 6 \cos\left(2\pi \cdot 10^6 \, t + 1.6 \sin(10000\pi t)\right)}

"If synchronized to the second path (50 ns) for same delays {0,50,120} ns, find T_m.","To find \( T_m \) (the minimum time required for synchronization), we need to analyze the delays given:  
\[
\{0, 50, 120\} \text{ ns}
\]

These represent delays on different paths in a system — likely in a timing or synchronization context like a clock distribution network or a multi-path signal propagation setup.

### Key Concept:
When synchronized to the **second path** (i.e., using the 50 ns path as reference), all other paths must adjust their timing so that they arrive at the same time as this reference path. The synchronization delay is typically determined by the **maximum delay** among the paths, because you must wait for the slowest path to catch up.

But the question asks:

> ""If synchronized to the second path (50 ns) for same delays {0, 50, 120} ns, find \( T_m \).""

This means:
- You’re synchronizing all paths to the second path’s arrival time (50 ns).
- So, the other paths must be delayed or adjusted so that they arrive at the same time as the 50 ns path.
- This implies you are finding the **minimum additional delay** needed across all paths to align them with the 50 ns path.

Let’s interpret it as:
- Each path has an inherent delay: 0 ns, 50 ns, and 120 ns.
- You want to make all of them appear to arrive at 50 ns — meaning, if a path arrives earlier, it must wait; if later, it must be rescheduled to arrive at 50 ns.

So, the total time \( T_m \) is the maximum amount of adjustment needed — i.e., how much you must delay the fastest path so that all paths converge at 50 ns.

But wait — there's a subtle point: If you're syncing everything to the 50 ns path, then:
- Path 1 (0 ns): Must wait 50 ns → total time = 50 ns
- Path 2 (50 ns): Already aligned → 0 ns additional delay
- Path 3 (120 ns): Arrives too late — must be delayed backwards (or the sync happens at 120 ns, not 50 ns)

Wait — that’s inconsistent.

### Better Interpretation:
In such problems, \( T_m \) usually refers to the **minimum time** after which all paths are guaranteed to have arrived at the destination (e.g., a common receiver), assuming each path is delayed appropriately to be synchronized.

If we use the **second path (50 ns)** as the reference time for synchronization (i.e., all paths must arrive by the time the 50 ns path does), then:
- The 0 ns path would need to be delayed by 50 ns (so it arrives at 50 ns)
- The 120 ns path arrives too late — it can't be made to arrive earlier than 120 ns unless we shift the reference.

So this suggests that **we cannot make all paths arrive before the slowest path**, so the only meaningful way to synchronize is to wait until the **slowest path** arrives — i.e., the 120 ns path.

Thus, if we are to ensure all paths are synchronized (i.e., all have arrived), we must wait until the last one arrives — at 120 ns.

But the phrase “synchronized to the second path (50 ns)” may mean that we are using the 50 ns path as a reference clock — so the system waits for all paths to reach that clock edge.

That leads us to:
- To ensure all paths are accounted for when the 50 ns path triggers the sync event, we must buffer or wait until the latest path arrives — but that’s 120 ns.

Alternatively, in a more precise timing analysis (like in a pipeline or clock domain crossing), the *minimum time* \( T_m \) is often calculated as the **maximum of the differences between each path and the reference path**.

Let’s define it as the **maximum deviation from the reference path (50 ns)**:

- Path 1: |0 - 50| = 50 ns
- Path 2: |50 - 50| = 0 ns
- Path 3: |120 - 50| = 70 ns

So the maximum deviation is **70 ns**.

This means: to align all paths with the 50 ns path, you must delay the 0 ns path by 50 ns and the 120 ns path by 70 ns (to make it arrive 70 ns later than its original delay — but that doesn’t make sense).

Actually, the correct interpretation is:

- If the 50 ns path is the reference, then:
  - To make path 0 ns arrive at the same time as 50 ns path, it must be delayed by 50 ns.
  - To make path 120 ns arrive at the same time as 50 ns path, it must be **advanced** by 70 ns — which may not be possible.

Hence, synchronization typically means all paths must arrive no later than the reference time — or all must be aligned to a common time by delaying the faster ones.

So, if you delay the faster paths by enough to match the slowest path, then the synchronization time is the **maximum path delay** — 120 ns.

But the question says “synchronized to the second path (50 ns)”, meaning that the sync event occurs at 50 ns — so all paths must have arrived by then.

Therefore, the only way this makes sense is:

- The system must wait until the **latest possible arrival** (120 ns), because that’s when all paths have definitely arrived — regardless of the 50 ns path being used as a reference.

So the answer is:

\[
T_m = \max(0, 50, 120) = 120 \text{ ns}
\]

\[
P_b = Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right)
\]

We need to find the required \( \frac{E_b}{N_0} \) in dB such that \( P_b = 10^{-3} \).

---

### Step 1: Set up the equation
\[
Q\left(\sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}}\right) = 10^{-3}
\]

Let \( x = \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} \), so:
\[
Q(x) = 10^{-3}
\]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)

From standard Q-function tables or using a calculator:
\[
Q(3.09) \approx 10^{-3}
\]

So,
\[
x \approx 3.09 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{E_b}{N_0}} = 3.09

Square both sides:
\[

- Target BER (Bit Error Rate): \( P_b = 10^{-4} \)
- Bit rate: \( R_b = 1 \, \text{Mbit/s} = 10^6 \, \text{bits/s} \)
- One-sided noise power spectral density: \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)
- DBPSK (Differential Binary Phase Shift Keying) BER formula:
  \[
  P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
  \]

We need to compute the required **received power** \( P_r \).

---

### Step 1: Solve for \( E_b / N_0 \)

From the BER formula:

\[
P_b = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Substitute \( P_b = 10^{-4} \):

\[
10^{-4} = \frac{1}{2} e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
2 \times 10^{-4} = e^{-E_b / N_0}
\]

Take natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = -\frac{E_b}{N_0}
\]

Compute the left-hand side:

\[
\ln(2 \times 10^{-4}) = \ln(2) + \ln(10^{-4}) = \ln(2) - 4 \ln(10)
\]
\[
\approx 0.6931 - 4 \times 2.3026 = 0.6931 - 9.2104 = -8.5173
\]

So:

\[
-\frac{E_b}{N_0} = -8.5173 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{E_b}{N_0} = 8.5173
\]

---

### Step 2: Compute \( E_b \)

\( E_b \) is the energy per bit:

\[
E_b = P_r \cdot T_b = \frac{P_r}{R_b}
\]

So:

\[
\frac{E_b}{N_0} = \frac{P_r / R_b}{N_0} = \frac{P_r}{R_b N_0}
\]

Set equal to 8.5173:

\[
\frac{P_r}{R_b N_0} = 8.5173
\]

Solve for \( P_r \):

\[
P_r = 8.5173 \cdot R_b \cdot N_0
\]

Plug in values:

- \( R_b = 10^6 \, \text{bits/s} \)
- \( N_0 = 2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{W/Hz} \)

\[
P_r = 8.5173 \times 10^6 \times 2 \times 10^{-20}
= 8.5173 \times 2 \times 10^{-14}
= 17.0346 \times 10^{-14}

### ✅ Final Answer:

\[
\boxed{P_r = 1.70 \times 10^{-13}} \, \text{W}

- \( B = 3.4 \, \text{kHz} = 3,400 \, \text{Hz} \)

We want to solve for SNR (linear), then convert to dB.

### Step 1: Plug into Shannon’s formula

\[

\]

Divide both sides by 3,400:

\[
\frac{20,000}{3,400} = \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})
\]

\[
5.8824 \approx \log_2(1 + \text{SNR})

"For the same amplifier, what is the output power when IM3 equals desired?","When **IM3 (Third-order Intermodulation Distortion)** equals the **desired signal level**, the output power is typically at or near the **1 dB compression point (P1dB)** of the amplifier.

### Explanation:
- In a nonlinear amplifier, as input power increases, the desired output power increases linearly at first, but eventually the amplifier begins to compress due to nonlinearities.
- IM3 products are generated when two tones (or signals) interact in the nonlinear region of the amplifier. The amplitude of IM3 increases with the cube of the input signal amplitude:  
  **IM3 ∝ (Input Power)³**
- The **third-order intercept point (IP3)** is a theoretical point where the extrapolated fundamental and IM3 powers intersect.
- When **IM3 = Desired Signal Level**, this corresponds to a situation where:
  - The distortion products (IM3) are equal in power to the desired signal — which is a severe level of distortion.
  - This condition typically occurs **about 1 dB below the P1dB** (the point where gain drops by 1 dB from the linear region).

### Therefore:
> ✅ **Output power when IM3 = Desired Signal Level ≈ P1dB – 1 dB**
