The correct form for the probability that the amplitude of a Rayleigh-distributed signal exceeds a threshold \( A_0 \) is:

\[
P(r > A_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2}\right)
\]

This is because the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a Rayleigh random variable \( r \) with scale parameter \( \sigma \) is:

\[
P(r \leq A_0) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
\]

For standard Rayleigh fading, \( \sigma^2 = 1 \), so the complementary CDF (i.e., the tail probability) becomes:

\[
P(r > A_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2}\right)
\]

Given this correction, let's redo the calculation properly.

---

### **Corrected Step 1: Identify given values and what is asked**
- Clipping probability: \( P_{\text{clipping}} = P(r > A_0) = \exp\left(-\frac{A_0^2}{2}\right) \)
- Given: \( A_0 = 2 \)

So now:
\[
P_{\text{clipping}} = \exp\left(-\frac{2^2}{2}\right) = \exp(-2)
\]

---

### **Corrected Step 2: Compute the value**
\[
\exp(-2) ≈ \frac{1}{e^2} ≈ \frac{1}{7.389} ≈ 0.1353
\]

---
